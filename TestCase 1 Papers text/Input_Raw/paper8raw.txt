The medical situation during disasters often difers from that at usual times. Disasters can lead to 
signifcant mortality that can be difcult to monitor. The types of disaster-related deaths are largely 
unknown. In this study, we conducted a survey to categorize the disaster-related deaths caused by 
a radiation disaster. A total of 520 people living in Minamisoma City, Fukushima Prefecture, at the 
time of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, who were certifed to have died due 
to disaster-related causes were surveyed. We divided the participants into those who were at home 
at the time of the earthquake and those who were in hospitals or facilities when the disaster struck 
and conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis of the two groups. Disaster-related deaths could be 
divided into seven groups for those who were at home at the time of the disaster and fve groups 
for those who were in hospitals or facilities at the time of the disaster. Each group showed diferent 
characteristics, such as "the group with disabilities," "the group receiving care," and "the group with 
depression," and it became evident that not only uniform post-disaster support, but support tailored 
to the characteristics of each group is necessary.
People experience long-term consequences in the event of a disaster1–3
. Since disasters can have a tremendous 
impact on healthcare, it is important to identify the challenges experienced by the healthcare sector in times of 
disaster and take appropriate steps to address them4–6
.
Disaster-related deaths are among the most important issues in disaster medicine and can be caused by secondary health efects of a disaster, such as emergency evacuation, relocation, shelter environment, disruption of 
healthcare delivery services, and psychosocial efects7
. Te environment of a disaster-stricken area during and 
afer a disaster difers from that of normal times in several ways, and thus interventions for the resulting problems 
require a diferent approach8
. Previous studies have reported that disaster-related deaths are caused by stress, 
fatigue, and worsening of pre-existing medical conditions due to long-term evacuation. Moreover, it has also 
been reported that these disaster-related deaths are more likely to occur in older adults in their 70 s to 80 s, with

no signifcant sex bias, and among those requiring nursing care. Respiratory diseases have been proclaimed to 
be the most common direct cause of disaster-related deaths9,10. However, the concept of disaster-related deaths 
itself is still new, and information is limited, necessitating further clarifcation.
Following the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and accident at the 
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP), evacuation orders were issued for large areas of the coastal 
region of the Fukushima Prefecture (Soma and Futaba areas), where the FDNPP is located. Hospitals around 
the nuclear power plant lost inpatients because they were unable to provide adequate care due to the reduction 
in medical staf and disconnection of medical infrastructure during the evacuation11–22. Indirect health efects, 
such as weakened early response medical systems, reduced access to medical care, changes in living conditions, 
and psychological and physical stress afer an accident, have been reported to increase the mortality rate23–31. 
Although capturing the nature of these disaster-related deaths is important for preventing casualties in largescale disasters, no detailed analysis has been conducted to identify the characteristics of disaster-related deaths 
among populations that died due to radiation disasters.
However, in non-standard cohort studies, such as disaster or pandemic studies, the methods of participant 
enrollment and data collection may difer from those of regular cohorts, thereby making it difcult to directly 
determine the overall characteristics from the collected data32–34. Terefore, to understand the overall characteristics of disaster-related deaths, it is important to develop a typology of these types of death cases and categorize 
each death into a group of similar type of cases.
Tis study aimed to clarify the characteristic patterns of disaster-related deaths in a radiation disaster by 
grouping similar case groups among those who died in Minamisoma City, where some areas were included in 
the evacuation-ordered zone afer the FDNPP accident. Identifying the typical patterns of disaster-related deaths 
in a major type of disaster will help gain more in-depth understanding of the nature of disaster-related deaths.
Materials and methods
Study design and setting
Tis retrospective observational study was conducted in Minamisoma City, Fukushima Prefecture, and included 
cases that were certifed as disaster-related deaths between September 2011 and February 2021.
Minamisoma City is located 11–38 km north of FDNPP. Immediately afer the FDNPP accident that occurred 
following the earthquake, the Japanese government issued an evacuation order within a 20 km radius and an 
indoor evacuation order within a 20–30 km radius. A few weeks afer the accident, the Japanese government 
divided Minamisoma City into four areas. Te area within a 20-km radius of the FDNPP was designated as 
the evacuation zone, the western part of the city outside the 20-km radius as the planned evacuation zone, the 
20–30 km radius of the FDNPP as the emergency evacuation preparation zone, and the area beyond the 30-km 
radius of the FDNPP as the non-evacuation zone. Odaka Ward in the southern part of Minamisoma City was 
designated as the evacuation zone because it is located within 20 km of the FDNPP. Te evacuation order 
was temporarily changed to "Preparation Zone for Lifing Evacuation Order," "Restricted Population Zone," 
and "Difcult-to-Return Zone." Finally, on July 12, 2016, the evacuation order was lifed with the exception of 
"Difcult-to-Return Zone”35 (Fig. 1).
Te study included a total of 520 people who lived in Minamisoma City on March 11, 2011, the day the Great 
East Japan Earthquake occurred, and whose deaths were certifed as disaster-related by the Minamisoma City 
Committee for Certifcation of Disaster-Related Deaths. Disaster-related deaths in Japan are certifed by the committee afer an examination performed by the municipality’s certifcation committee based on an application form 
submitted by the bereaved family of the deceased. Terefore, the defnition of disaster-related deaths in this study 
conformed to the criteria used by the Minamisoma City Committee for recognition of disaster-related deaths.
Te Minamisoma City Ofce in Fukushima Prefecture provided us with the application forms and accompanying materials of the 520 targeted people who were certifed as having died from disaster-related causes. Tese 
application forms and accompanying materials written by the bereaved families of the deceased were used to 
collect data and create the "Minamisoma City Disaster-Related Death Database" (MCDRD data). Te following 
24 items without descriptive elements were selected and extracted from the MCDRD data: sex, age at the time 
of death, evacuation, number of evacuations, number of movements, situation when moving, moving location, 
accommodation, evacuation housing, household, receiving care certifcation, disability, increased alcohol consumption, insomnia, depression, dementia, decreased social participation, decreased communication, days since 
the earthquake, place of death, March 11 residence classifcation (<20 km,<30 km), March 11 hospitalization or 
inpatient status, March 11 ward of residence, and direct cause of death. Te MCDRD data used in this study are 
not publicly available as they contain personal information and were provided for sole use in our series of studies.
Data analysis
Organize background information
In this study, the causes of death were classifed according to the International Classifcation of Diseases 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) to make the causes of death statistically tractable. Direct causes of death were substituted 
for those without a description of the cause of death. For individuals with more than one listed cause of death, 
multiple authors consulted each other, considered other descriptions of the circumstances at the time of death, 
and selected the most appropriate cause.
Afer replacing the cause of death with the ICD-10 code, basic statistics for each variable were calculated. 
Means and variances were calculated for continuous variables and the number in each category was counted for 
categorical data (Table 1).

Clustering background information
To determine how disaster-related deaths could be classifed according to the 24 types of background information, excluding the direct causes of death, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the background 
information using the Ward method36 with square Euclidean distance. Previous studies in Fukushima have 
revealed diferences in the characteristics of those who died at home compared to those who died in hospitals or 
institutions14,15,37. Terefore, statistical analysis was performed to compare the background information between 
those who died at home and those who died in a hospital or institution, and signifcant diferences were found 
(Supplemental Table 1). Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted separately for those who were at home 
and those who were in hospitals or institutions at the time of the earthquake. One person whose residence at 
the time of the earthquake was unknown was excluded from the analysis. While conducting the analysis, there 
were 17 items of binary data and continuous variables: sex, age at the time of death, whether or not the person 
was evacuated, number of times evacuated, number of times moved, situation at the time of move, location of 
move, family situation (which meant single at the time of death or not), disability, whether or not the person was 
receiving nursing care at the time of the disaster, increased drinking opportunities and alcohol consumption, 
insomnia, depressed mood, development or severity of dementia, decreased social participation and activities, 
decreased communication, and date since disaster. Missing values were added using the multiple assignment 
method. Each variable was standardized (Z-score) to ensure that the data scale was uniform. Te number of 
clusters was determined by combining the tree diagrams (Fig. 2), which were created when the Ward method was 
implemented, and the interpretability of the results was good. Afer clustering, color coding was performed for 
each cluster class on the dimensionality-reduced data using the t-SNE38 algorithm to visualize the results (Fig. 3).
Analysis of cluster results and their factors
To clarify the relationship between the background information and the degree to which the results of the cluster 
performed earlier were infuenced by the factors, a table summarizing the relationship between each class and 
variable was created (Tables 2 and 3). Categorical variables were counted by category, and continuous variables 
were derived as means and variances. Te number of participants before cluster analysis was sufcient, but some 
clusters had few participants, and these were considered the minority. In addition, to clarify the variables that 
contributed to the cluster results, the Fisher’s exact method was applied to the cluster results for categorical variables, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to continuous variables, and efect sizes were derived. 
V≥0.50 and η2≥0.14 were determined to have a large efect size39. Fisher’s exact test or one-way ANOVA was 
performed only for groups with 30 or more participants. In contrast, descriptive statistics were used for minority

the relationship between the cluster results and background factors. (Fig. 4).
Tese analyses were performed using python version 3.9.7.
Ethics declarations
Tis study was approved by the Minamisoma Municipal General Hospital Ethics Committee (approval number:2-21) and the Fukushima Medical University Ethics Committee (reference number:2020-297). As data were 
evaluated retrospectively and pseudonymously and were solely obtained for treatment purposes, the requirement 
for informed consent was waived by the ethics committees of Minamisoma Municipal General Hospital and 
the Fukushima Medical University. Te study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration 
of Helsinki.
Results
Data summary
Of the 520 patients enrolled in the MCDRD data, 267 (51.3%) were male and 253 (48.7%) were female. Te 
mean age of the study population was 83 (range 14–105, median 85, standard deviation 11.9) years. At the 
time of the earthquake, 272 (52.3%) individuals were receiving long-term care, and 56 (10.8%) had disabilities. 
Te residences of 321 (61.7%), 56 (10.8%), and 133 (25.6%) study participants were in Haramachi, Kashima, 
and Odaka, respectively. Afer the earthquake, 243 (46.8%) participants showed symptoms of mood swings or 
depression, and 493 (94.8%) were evacuated. Dementia worsened in 100 (19.2%) patients, and 105 (20.2%) had 
insomnia (Table 1).
Results of each class on the basis of cluster analysis (group that was at home at the time of 
the earthquake)
A total of 252 people were at home at the time of the disaster, and the nature of these disaster-related deaths 
could be divided into seven categories: Class H1, 17 (6.7%); Class H2, 21 (8.3%); Class H3, 42 (16.7%); Class 
H4, 4 (1.6%); Class H5, 64 (25.4%); Class H6, 17 (6.7%); and Class H7, 87 (34.5%). Te leading causes of death 
were cardiovascular diseases, 62 (24.6%); malignant neoplasms, 59 (23.4%); and respiratory diseases, 51 (20.2%) 
(Table 2).
Te characteristics of each cluster, listed in order of number of persons, were as follows. Typical example of 
Class H7 was "elderly with depression" {age (85.8±9.44 years, p<0.001, η2=0.12), depression [yes, 55 (63.2%) 
and no, 0 (0.0%)], receiving care certifcation [yes, 45 (51.7%) and no, 32 (36.8%), p<0.001, V=0.44], and the 
number of days from the earthquake to death (192.0±137.6, p<0.001, η2=0.26)}. In Class H5, the typical cases 
included “those who had not received care certifcation or were not disabled, but had reduced social activity 
and depressive feelings” {reduced social activity [yes, 54 (84.4%) and no, 4 (6.2%), p<0.001, V=0.38], depression [yes, 49 (76.6%) and no, 0 (0.0%)], receiving care certifcation [yes, 7 (10.9%) and no, 56(87.5%), p<0.001, 
V=0.44], disability [yes, 3 (4.7%) and no, 61 (95.3%), p=0.06, V=0.17], and number of days from the earthquake 
to death (611.5±514.2)}. Typical example of Class H3 comprised "those with no care certifcation or disability, 
no impaired communication, but with depressive feelings" {impaired communication [yes, 1 (2.4%) and no,

V=0.17], and number of days from the earthquake to death (228.8±225.0, p<0.001, η2=0.26)}. A typical example of class H2 was "elderly, without disability or depression, and those who received care certifcation" {age 
(85.9±9.24 years), depression [yes, 0 (0.0%) and no, 16 (76.2%)], receiving care certifcation [yes, 15 (71.4%)

death (51.7±39.2)}. For Class H1, a typical example was "those who did not receive care certifcation or were 
not disabled and did not evacuate afer the earthquake but stayed at home” { evacuation [yes, 0 (0.0%) and no, 
17 (100%)], receiving care certifcation [yes, 3 (17.6%) and no, 12 (70.6%)], disability [yes, 1 (5.9%) and no, 16 
(94.1%)], and the number of days from the earthquake to death (98.0 ± 172.3)}.Typical example of Class H6 
comprised those who were “depressed and disabled” {depression [yes, 15 (88.2%) and no, 0 (0.0%)], disability 
[yes, 17 (100.0%) and no, 0 (0.0%)], and number of days from the disaster to death (488.1±432.9)}. A typical 
example of Class H4 was "those with depression and increased alcohol consumption" {depression [yes, 3 (75%) 
and no, 0 (0.0%)], increased alcohol consumption [yes, 4 (100%) and no, 0 (0.0%)], and number of days from 
the disaster to death (667.5±237.6)}.
Results of cluster analysis for each class (group that was in a hospital or facility at the time of 
the earthquake)
A total of 267 people were in hospitals or institutions at the time of the disaster, and the nature of these disasterrelated deaths can be divided into fve categories: Class I1, 82 (30.1%); Class I2, 9 (3.4%); Class I3, 73 (27.3%); 
Class I4, 16 (6.0%); and Class I5, 87 (32.6%). Te leading causes of death were respiratory diseases, 92 (34.5%); 
circulatory diseases, 61 (22.8%); and senility, 50 (18.7%) (Table 3).
Te characteristics of each cluster, listed in order of number of persons, were as follows. A typical examples of Class I5 was "those exhibiting decreased social activity and depression, and receiving care certifcation" 
{decreased social participation [yes, 61 (70.1%) and no, 0 (0.0%), p<0.001,V=0.73], depression [yes, 47 (54.0%)

Factors that largely distinguished the characteristics of each group were the presence or absence of a disability, 
receiving care certifcation, evacuation, and depression (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study, the average age of those identifed as disaster-related deaths was 82.7±11.9 years, which is consistent with previous reports that these deaths tend to occur in people in their 70 s and 80 s, with no signifcant sex 
bias7,10,40. Among people who were at home at the time of the disaster, only three of the seven groups received 
nursing care, whereas among those in a hospital or facility, only one of the fve groups did not receive nursing 
care. Tis analysis is signifcant, as it helped extract a population that did not receive nursing care from a population with many care recipients and vice versa.
Tis study showed that disaster-related deaths in a radiation disaster can be divided into seven groups for 
those who were at home at the time of the disaster and into fve groups for those who were in a hospital or at a 
facility at the time of the disaster. Clear diferences were evident in the groups’ causes of death. Te people at 
home had more deaths from circulatory diseases and malignant neoplasms, which accounted for approximately 
half of all deaths. While those in a hospital or facility had more deaths due to respiratory diseases and senility, 
which also accounted for one-third of all deaths. Te two groups also difered in terms of the diseases to which 
they were prone.
However, the two groups also shared some similarities. Regardless of the location of the disaster, people in 
the groups that had a longer period between the disaster and their death experienced depressive feelings. Most 
of the individuals belonging to the people at home and in a hospital or facility exhibited depressive feelings 
afer an average of 100 and 170 days, respectively, suggesting that they may have been more likely to become 
depressed 3 months following the disaster. Tis is possibly because long-term evacuation prolongs the efects of 
environmental changes, which consequently increases the psychological impact on the survivors, thus raising 
the risk of death. Tis is consistent with previous studies which reported that long-term depressive feelings afer 
disasters are more likely to lead to death25,26,41,42.
Notably, that the time to death in clusters I4 and H5, which included people with disabilities, was approximately 610–670 days, which was longer in comparison to that in other clusters, suggesting that the characteristics 
of disaster-related deaths among people with disabilities may difer from those of other groups. Te reason for 
this is thought to be that disaster victims weaken over the long term due to prolonged evacuation and changes in 
post-disaster medical services that gradually afect their lives. Disabilities that did not have a signifcant impact 
on them before the disaster gradually begins to afect their lives. Previous studies have reported that people with 
disabilities take longer to recover afer disasters8,43 and there have been cases of people dying from long-term 
efects of disasters37. Tese fndings are consistent with the present study results, which showed that people with 
disabilities succumb to long-term efects. Interview research to clarify how people with disabilities are afected 
and weakened is warranted in the future.
People living in institutions or hospitals at the time of the disaster were divided into three groups according to 
the duration of time before their death. Individuals belonging to one group died within 2 months, another within 
3–6 months, and the other within 6 months due to the acute, subacute, and chronic efects afer the earthquake, 
respectively. Previous similar studies have shown that people in facilities die within one to two months afer a 
disaster, primarily due to evacuation44. However, in this study, we found that some people died before evacuation, for example class I
2
, and others died afer six months, such as class I4 or I5, which had not been found 
in previous studies. Future studies are required to accumulate more research evidence regarding such groups.
Tis study revealed that people without receiving and not receiving nursing care who were living at home 
at the time of the disaster and had depressive tendencies could be divided into two main categories: those with 
reduced social activity and communication with others (such as class H5) and those without these characteristics (such as class H3). In the frst category, it is considered that the environmental factors due to prolonged 
evacuation resulted in reduced social activity and caused depressive tendencies. However, in the second group, 
it is contemplated that these characteristics were not related to the disaster, but occurred because the person 
originally showed depressive tendencies, such as mental illness and cancer. Previous studies45–48 have suggested 
that people with depression were afected by changes in the social environment afer the earthquake. However, 
some people who have depression without such efects, which seems to be a new fnding.
An important fnding is that while some debilitated people who originally had serious illnesses died within 
three months of the disaster, others lingered beyond three months and developed depression. Moreover, these 
long-term survivors not only included originally healthy individuals, but also those with disabilities and preexisting medical conditions. Tese facts suggest that post-disaster support for disaster victims may require not 
only uniform support, but also group-specifc continuous support. In addition, mental health care was required 
3 months afer the disaster. Tese are important fndings on chronic disaster care for future disaster medicine.
Limitations
However, this study had a few limitations which need consideration. First, the classifcations are used to observe 
group tendencies and do not consider every individual’s behavior. Tis aspect should be considered when conducting qualitative surveys in the future to determine individual characteristics. Furthermore, a more detailed 
analysis with the population stratifed by various demographic factors, such as age and sex, is necessary. Second, 
data were registered based on applications from family members of those who died in disaster-related deaths, 
which were classifed by the authors. Tis may have resulted in some bias because some parts were not based on 
objective indicators. However, the judgments by multiple raters would have reduced this bias. Tird, there was 
a large amount of missing data regarding questions such as motivation to engage in social activities and depressive tendencies, with sleep disorders at the top of the list. Tese were complemented by the multiple assignment

method, which has limited accuracy. However, when a similar analysis was conducted using only data that did 
not include missing values, the participants were classifed into similar clusters, suggesting that the multiple 
assignment method is a reasonable complement.
Conclusion
Radiation disaster-related deaths can be divided into seven categories for those who were at home at the time 
of the disaster and into fve categories for those who were in hospitals or facilities at the time of the disaster. 
Tese clusters can be classifed based on “residential status at the time of the disaster,” “receiving long-term care 
certifcation,” “presence of disabilities,” “presence of depression,” and “experience of evacuation.” Moreover, these 
clusters included “people who did not evacuate afer the disaster and stayed at home,” “people with disabilities,” 
“people receiving care,” and “people with depressive feelings.” Some of the individuals belonging to these categories originally had serious illnesses and died within three months of the disaster, while others survived until 
afer three months and began to experience depressive feelings. In addition, each category had distinct diseases 
that were likely to be the cause of death, such as “the group with more deaths from malignant neoplasms,” “the 
group with more deaths from respiratory diseases,” and “the group with more deaths from debilitating diseases”. 
Te prolonged group not only included those who were originally healthy, but also those with disabilities and 
pre-existing medical conditions. Tese fndings suggest that assisting disaster victims not only require uniform 
support, but also individual support based on the group and category they belong to.
