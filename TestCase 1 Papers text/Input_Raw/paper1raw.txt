ABSTRACT
The alignment between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and host clusters can reveal the mystery of the formation and
evolution of galaxy clusters. We measure cluster orientations in optical based on the projected distribution of member galaxies
and in X-ray by fitting the morphology of intracluster medium (ICM). Cluster orientations determined in the two wavelengths
are generally consistent. The orientation alignment between BCGs and host clusters is confirmed and more significant than in
previous works. We find that BCGs are more aligned with cluster orientations measured in X-ray than those from optical data.
Clusters with a brighter BCG generally show a stronger alignment. We argue that the detected redshift evolution of the alignment
is probably caused by observational bias rather than intrinsic evolution. The alignment is not related to the ellipticity of BCGs,
and the richness, ellipticity, and dynamical state of host clusters. The strong alignment between BCGs and the morphology of
ICMs may be the consequence of the co-evolution between the central massive galaxy and host clusters.
Key words: galaxies: clusters: general – galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium.
1 INTRODUCTION
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the
Universe ,formed by accreting materials along filaments and merging
smaller groups or subclusters (e.g. Press & Schechter 1974; Bower
1991; Springel et al. 2005; McGee et al. 2009). The anisotropic
processes for mass assembly lead clusters and their member galaxies
orient non-randomly (e.g. Dubinski 1998; Altay, Colberg & Croft
2006; Faltenbacher et al. 2008; Knebe et al. 2008). Satellite galaxies
in groups or clusters tend to point to the central massive galaxies
(e.g. Thompson 1976; Pereira & Kuhn 2005; Yang et al. 2006;
Faltenbacher et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2018). BCGs are observed
to align with their host clusters (hereafter ‘BCG alignment’ or ‘the
alignment’ for short, e.g. Sastry 1968; Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010;
Hao et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2016; West et al. 2017; Wittman,
Foote & Golovich 2019). On larger scales, galaxy groups or clusters
also orient toward their neighbours statistically (e.g. Binggeli 1982;
Rhee & Katgert 1987; West 1989; Wang et al. 2009; Smargon et al.
2012). Investigations on the orientation alignment of galaxies, groups
and clusters provide a unique way to understand their formation and
evolution histories (see reviews: Kiessling et al. 2015; Kirk et al.
2015; Joachimi et al. 2015)
BCGs are the most massive galaxies in clusters, generally inhabit
the dense environment of cluster centres. They gain masses through
accreting materials from the ICM or cannibalizing satellite galaxies
(e.g. Ostriker & Hausman 1977; Fabian 1994; Dubinski 1998; Nipoti,
Giocoli & Despali 2018), and show peculiar properties in many
aspects when compared to normal elliptical galaxies (e.g. Burns,
White & Hough 1981; Best et al. 2007; Lin, Ostriker & Miller 2010;
Shen et al. 2014; Wen & Han 2015a). On the one hand, the properties
 E-mail: zsyuan@nao.cas.cn
of BCGs are affected by the ambient environment (e.g. Mittal et al.
2009; Kale et al. 2015; Yuan, Han & Wen 2016); on the other hand,
BCGs can regulate the distribution of surrounding gases and heat
them significantly through AGN feedback (e.g. Cattaneo et al. 2009;
Ma, McNamara & Nulsen 2013). The orientation alignment indicates
the tight links between BCGs and host clusters.
The formation of the BCG alignment isstill controversial: whether
the alignment is created primordially and maintained to now, or it
appears gradually during the process of mass assembly of BCGs.
This could be partly answered by comparing the alignment signal in
different redshifts. Niederste-Ostholt et al. (2010) and Hao et al.
(2011) found stronger alignment for lower redshift clusters, but
Huang et al. (2016) claimed that no clear redshift evolution is
detected. By using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), West et al.
(2017) found that the BCG alignment has been clearly set ten billion
years ago (see also Chu et al. 2021).
Generally, the mass distribution of galaxy clusters can be well
traced by the distribution of their member galaxies (e.g. Broadhurst
et al. 2005; Zitrin et al. 2009, 2011). The overall orientation of
clusters thus can be measured with the positions of member galaxies
(e.g. Sastry 1968; Carter & Metcalfe 1980). Clear BCG alignment
has been detected for large cluster samples (e.g. Niederste-Ostholt
et al. 2010; Hao et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2016). Relations between
the alignment strength and cluster properties are also discussed. For
example, clusters with a more luminous or more dominant BCG
usually show more remarkable alignments (e.g. Niederste-Ostholt
et al. 2010; Hao et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2016). While marginal or
no dependence is found on the richness of clusters (e.g. Hao et al.
2011; Huang et al. 2016).
The cluster mass can also be reflected by the distribution of ICM
(e.g. Fabricant,Rybicki & Gorenstein 1984; Allen, Schmidt & Fabian
2002), thus the global orientation of galaxy clusters can be determined from their X-ray morphologies. Based on Einstein images,

Porter, Schneider & Hoessel (1991) found clear BCG alignments
with 41 clusters, and Rhee & Latour (1991) got consistent results for
26 clusters. Allen et al. (1995) detected the BCG alignment in five
clusters observed by the ROSAT. Hashimoto, Henry & Boehringer
(2008) studied the alignment for 30 clusters with Chandra images,
in much higher angular resolution than the Einstein and ROSAT
images. Donahue et al. (2016) confirmed the BCG alignment for 25
clusters, no matter the cluster orientation is measured from X-ray
(Chandra), Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect (Bolocam) or lensing (HST)
data. All the above X-ray samples are very limited, insufficient to
further investigate the influence of cluster properties on the BCG
alignment.
The Chandra and XMM–Newton satellites have accumulated
massive data for galaxy clusters. Recently, we processed the archival
Chandra (Yuan & Han 2020) and XMM–Newton (Yuan, Han & Wen
2022) data homogeneously, and obtained X-ray images for 1844
clusters in total. It is feasible now to measure the orientation of
clusters in both optical and X-ray wavelengths for a large sample of
clusters. In Section 2, we describe the cluster samples and derive the
shape parameters. Results on the BCG alignment are presented in
Section 3. A summary is given in Section 4. Throughout this paper,
we assume a flat CDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1,
m = 0.3 and  = 0.7.
2 DATA
2.1 Cluster samples
The cluster sample in X-ray is derived from the archival data of
the Chandra and XMM–Newton (Yuan & Han 2020; Yuan et al.
2022). Galaxy clusters are collected in two independent approaches:
(1) clusters from targeted observations, and (2) those serendipitously
detected. The X-ray images of clusters are processed homogeneously,
and smoothed to a certain physical scale of 30 kpc (refer Yuan &
Han 2020; Yuan et al. 2022, for details on the sample collection
and image procssing). Finally, 964 clusters are obtained from
Chandra images (Yuan & Han 2020), 1308 clusters are from XMM–
Newton images, and a joint sample with 1844 clusters is derived
by combining the Chandra and XMM–Newton samples (Yuan et al.
2022).
In optical, the large cluster catalogue derived by Wen & Han
(2015b) is used. Wen, Han & Liu (2012) identified 132 684 clusters
from the photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
Wen & Han (2015b) updated this catalogue based on the SDSS
spectroscopic data (Alam et al. 2015), and identified 25 419 new
clusters. In total, the sample in Wen & Han (2015b) contains 158 103
clusters.
We cross-match the X-ray joint sample in Yuan et al. (2022) with
the optical catalogue in Wen & Han (2015b) within the cluster radius
r500, the radius of a cluster within which the mean matter density
is 500 times of the local critical density. Preliminarily, we get 755
clusters overlapped in the X-ray and optical samples.
2.2 Parameters of galaxy clusters
2.2.1 Orientation and ellipticity of BCGs
Based on the BCG coordinates in the catalogue of Wen & Han
(2015b), we directly get the position angle φbcg (deVPhi r) and the
axial ratio b/a (deVAB r) of BCGs, fitted with the de Vancouleurs

ellipticity εbcg is defined as
εbcg = 1 − b/a
1 + b/a . (1)
The φbcg is measured from the north through the east within 0◦
≤ φbcg < 180◦. As an example, the upper panel of Fig. 1 shows
the SDSS image for the BCG of Abell 68 and the fitted position
angle. In the lower panel of Fig. 1, we present the distribution of
φbcg (dashed) for the 755 overlapped clusters, and find it follows the
random distribution quite well.
2.2.2 Orientation and ellipticity of clusters estimated from member
galaxies
The orientation of clusters can be derived from the distribution of
member galaxies (e.g. Kim et al. 2002; Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010;

where xi, yi are the relative angular distances in the right ascension
and declination directions, respectively, of the ith satellite galaxy
to the BCG, ri is equal to x2
i + y2
i , and Nsat is the number of
satellite galaxies in the cluster. Here, we only adopt satellite galaxies
satisfying: (1) the r-band absolute magnitude is brighter than −20.5
mag, and (2) the projected distance to the BCG is less than r500. The
two parameters Q and U are defined as
Q = Mxx − Myy ,
U = 2Mxy . (3)

The φclstr, o is measured from the north through the east within 0◦

for the Abell 68 and the corresponding position angle φclstr, o are
presented as an example. In the lower panel of Fig. 1, we present
the distribution of φclstr, o for 755 clusters and find that the cluster
orientations (dash–dotted) are randomly distributed in the projected
plane.
The deviation angle between the BCG and host cluster thus can
be calculated through

o = |φbcg − φclstr, o| (|φbcg − φclstr, o| ≤ 90◦),
o = 180◦ − |φbcg − φclstr, o| (|φbcg − φclstr, o| > 90◦). (6)
Here, the o is in 0◦ ≤ o ≤ 90◦.

by the XMM–Newton. The scale of 500 kpc is labelled on the bottom righthand corner. Lower panel: the best-fitted β-model for the X-ray image with
the position angle φclstr, x marked.
2.2.3 Orientation and ellipticity of clusters estimated from X-ray
images
The orientation and ellipticity of host clusters can also be measured
by fitting the cluster X-ray images with a two-dimensional β-model
as (see Yuan & Han 2020, for details)
f (x, y) = f (r) = A(1 + (r/r0)

where
r(x, y) =

, (8)
and
x = (x − x0) cos φclstr, x + (y − y0)sin φclstr, x,
y = (y − y0) cos φclstr, x − (x − x0)sin φclstr, x. (9)
Here, εclstr, x is the cluster ellipticity, φclstr, x is the position angle from
the north through the east within 0◦ ≤ φclstr, x < 180◦. The upper
panel of Fig. 3 shows the X-ray image of Abell 68 observed by the
XMM–Newton, refer Yuan et al. (2022) for details. In the lower panel,
the corresponding β-model and the fitted cluster orientation φclstr, x
are presented. The distribution of φclstr, x (dotted) for 755 clusters is
shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1, follows the random distribution
perfectly.

x = 180◦ − |φbcg − φclstr, x| (|φbcg − φclstr, x| > 90◦), (10)
where the x is in the range of 0◦ ≤ x ≤ 90◦.
Since the uncertainty of measured orientationsislarger for rounder
sources (e.g. see Refregier et al. 2012), previous works usually set
a threshold for the ellipticity (e.g. Yang et al. 2006; NiedersteOstholt et al. 2010). In this paper, we limit ellipticities, including
the εbcg, εclstr, o and εclstr, x, larger than 0.1. Meanwhile, because the
measurement of the orientation φclstr, o is inaccurate for clusters with
few members, we only use φclstr, o that estimated from clusters with

satisfying the above selection criteria.
2.2.4 Other parameters
To study the relation between BCG alignment and properties of
BCGs or host clusters, we get the BCG redshift z, the r-band
absolute magnitude of BCGs Mbcg, the number of satellite galaxies
Nsat, and the cluster richness Rclstr from the catalogue in Wen &
Han (2015b). About 90 per cent of the BCG redshifts are estimated from spectroscopic data. The absolute magnitude Mbcg is
evolution-corrected with Mbcg = Mobs
bcg + 1.16z. The cluster richness
Rclstr is estimated by the total luminosity of member galaxies and
can be taken as a good mass proxy of clusters (Wen & Han
2015b).
In Yuan et al. (2022), we calculated four kinds of dynamical
parameters with X-ray images, i.e. the concentration index c, the
centroid shift ω, the power ratio P3/P0, and the morphology index
δ. Since these parameters are tightly correlated with each other
(Yuan & Han 2020), we only take the adaptive morphology index
δ as the dynamical parameter for clusters in following discussions.
The morphology index δ is defined as the best combination of the
profile parameter κ and the asymmetry factor α estimated from the
maps of surface brightness. It is calibrated by using a complete
sample of clusters with known relaxed and disturbed state. Clusters
with δ < 0 are relaxed, while those with δ > 0 are regarded as
disturbed clusters. All the parametersfor the 411 clusters are listed in
Table 1.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Comparing cluster orientations estimated from optical and
X-ray data
Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational
potential well of clusters, the distributions of member galaxies and
ICM are both regulated by the mass distribution of galaxy clusters.
Thus, it is natural to expect a general agreement between cluster
orientations determined from member galaxies and those from the
ICM. In the upper left-hand panel of Fig. 4, a good consistency
is presented between cluster orientations estimated from optical
(φclstr, o) and X-ray (φclstr, x) data, though few clusters present large
deviations. In the upper right-hand panel of Fig. 4, we show the
distribution of the differences between cluster orientations measured
in optical and X-ray wavelengths, 
φclstr, and fit the distribution with
a Gaussian model as

Here, A is the model amplitude, 0 is the model centre and set to

◦43. The lower left-hand panel of
Fig. 4 shows the correlation between the 
φclstr and the number of
satellite galaxiesin clusters Nsat. We assessthe degree of Nsat−
φclstr
correlation with the significance of Spearman rank-order correlation
ps (defined in Press et al. 1992, p. 640), which is a very sensitive
indicator for weak but intrinsic tendency, with the zero value for
a significant dependence while non-zero values for independence.
We find that clusters host more satellite galaxies tend to show better
agreement between the φclstr, o and φclstr, x. In the lower right-hand
panel of Fig. 4, we find that the 
φclstr is independent of the cluster
redshift z.
3.2 The BCG alignment
In the upper panel of Fig. 5, we show the distributions of the deviation
angles  between orientations of BCGs and host clusters. A clear
signal of alignment is shown – the fraction of clusters with  <
30◦ is significantly larger than those with a larger . We find that
the x (solid) shows stronger alignment than the o (shaded). The
distributions of x and o are fitted with a Gaussian model, as stated
in equation (11) and presented in the lower panels of Fig. 5. The bestfitted parameters for each samples are listed in Table 2. It is clear that
the fitted model for x has a significantly larger amplitude A and a
smaller width σ than those of the o. This suggests that the BCG
morphology is more aligned with the distribution of ICM than that
of satellite galaxies.
In Table 2, the mean deviation angles and fitting parameters for
the results obtained by Niederste-Ostholt et al. (2010) and Huang
et al. (2016) are also presented. The alignments we obtained are
significantly stronger, i.e. larger A and smaller σ and . This is
probably because our sample is derived from the common sample
in X-ray and optical and under stricter selection criteria, e.g. Nsat ≥
10, which leads our sample has a smaller uncertainty than that of
previous works.
3.3 Correlations to properties of BCGs or clusters
Correlations between the alignment strength and various properties
of BCGs or clusters have been studied, see Table 3 as a summary.

Figure 8. The cumulative distribution of the deviation angle x for clusters
with different ranges of redshift. The dotted straight line is the theoretical line
for non-alignment.
However, many inconsistencies are obtained by different authors.
For example, Niederste-Ostholt et al. (2010) and Hao et al. (2011)
found that the BCG alignment is more prominent at lower redshifts,
while Huang et al. (2016) did not find this trend. Hashimoto et al.
(2008) found that clusters with a more elongated BCG generally
show stronger BCG alignment, but Huang et al. (2016) argued that
the dependence on the BCG ellipticity is probably due to selection
effects.
Here, we search the relation between the BCG alignment and the
redshift z, the BCG absolute magnitude Mbcg and ellipticity εbcg,
and the richness Rclstr and dynamical parameter δ of host clusters.
As shown in the left-most two columns of Fig. 6, only the BCG
absolute magnitude Mbcg shows significant dependence, i.e. ps = 0,
for x and o simultaneously. In Fig. 7, we divide the 411 clusters
into two subsamples with the boundary of Mbcg = −23.5 mag,
and compare the cumulative fraction of the two subsamples for x
(left-hand panel) and o (right-hand panel), respectively. It is clear
that the subsample with more luminous BCGs (dashed) presents
stronger alignment signal than the fainter subsample (solid). The
corresponding probability of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test,
pks, between the two subsamples is equal 0.00 for the x and equal
to 0.01 for the o, indicating a significantly different distribution
between the two subsamples.
The redshift evolution of the BCG alignment has been discussed
(e.g. Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010; Hao et al. 2011; Huang et al.
2016). In Fig. 6, we find a clear dependence of x on the cluster
redshift z, though the dependence vanishes for the o. Fig. 8
shows the cumulative fraction of x for subsamples with different
ranges of redshift. We find that the distributions are similar between
subsamples for z ≤ 0.15 (solid) and 0.15 < z ≤ 0.30 (dashed), but it
changessignificantly forthe subsample with 0.30<z ≤0.45 (dotted),
and then keeps stable for z > 0.45 (dash–dotted). Considering the
discontinuous changes among subsamples with different redshifts,
we argue that the changes are not originated from intrinsic evolution,
but probably a consequence of observational selection effect, i.e. the
uncertainty of BCG orientations measured from the SDSS images
becomes larger at z > 0.3.
Fig. 6 shows the significance ps of the x−δ correlation is equal
to 0, but it changes to 0.53 for the o−δ correlation. Considering the
inconsistency between the x and o, we conclude that no intrinsic
relation is found between the BCG alignment and the dynamical
state of host clusters. For other parameters, i.e. the BCG ellipticity
εbcg, the cluster richness Rclstr and ellipticity εclstr, x and εclstr, o, the
Fig. 6 presents no dependence to both x and o. The results from
literature and that obtained by us are summarized in Table 3.
4 SUMMARY
Investigations on the BCG alignment and the correlations with
properties of BCGs and clusters are helpful to understand the coevolution of clusters and their central massive galaxies. In this work,
we combine the large X-ray sample derived by Yuan et al. (2022)
and the huge optical catalogue from Wen & Han (2015b). The
position angle of BCGs φbcg is directly taken from the SDSS database.
The orientations of host clusters are calculated in two independent
approaches: (1) the φclstr, o is computed with the distribution of
member galaxies, and (2) the φclstr, x is obtained by fitting the X-ray
image of clusters with an elliptical β-model. By setting thresholds
on ellipticities and number of satellite galaxies, finally a sample of
411 clusters are obtained.
We find that cluster orientations measured from X-ray images
are generally consistent with that determined from optical data. We
confirm the BCG alignment and find BCGs are more aligned with
the distribution of ICM compared to that of member galaxies. The
alignment signal obtained by us is much stronger than that from

literature. We find that clusters with more luminous BCGs show
stronger BCG alignment statistically. We argue that the detected
changes of the BCG alignment related to the redshift is mainly caused
by selection effectsrather than intrinsic physical evolution. The BCG
alignment is independent of the BCG ellipticity, and the richness,
ellipticty and dynamical state of host clusters.
