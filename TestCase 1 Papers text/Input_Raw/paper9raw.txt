Abstract 
Recent research showed significant stretch-mediated maximum 
strength increases when performing stretching between 5 to 120 
minutes per day with the calf muscle. However, since the practical applicability of these long stretching durations was questioned 
and studies exploring the transferability to the upper body are
scarce, the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of 
using a home-based stretching program to induce significant increases in maximum strength and flexibility. Therefore, 31 recreationally active participants (intervention group: 18, control 
group: 13) stretched the pectoralis major for 15min/day for eight 
weeks, incorporating three different stretching exercises. The 
maximum strength was tested isometrically and dynamically in 
the bench press (one-repetition maximum: 1RM) as well as shoulder range of motion (ROM) performing bilateral shoulder rotation 
with a scaled bar. Using a two-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with repeated measures, the results showed high magnitude Time effects (ƞ² = 0.388 - 0.582, p < 0.001) and 
Group*Time interaction (ƞ² = 0.281 - 0.53, p < 0.001 - 0.002), 
with increases of 7.4 ± 5.6% in 1RM and of 9.8 ± 5.0% in ROM 
test in the intervention group. In the isometric testing, there was 
a high-magnitude Time effect (ƞ² = 0.271, p = 0.003), however, 
the Group*Time interaction failed to reach significance (p = 
0.75). The results are in line with previous results that showed 
stretch-mediated maximum strength increases in the lower extremity. Future research should address the underlying physiological mechanisms such as muscle hypertrophy, contraction conditions as well as pointing out the relevance of intensity, training 
frequency and stretching duration.

Introduction 
Maximum strength is stated as a basic ability in sports performance (Wirth et al., 2016). Using resistance training to 
improve lower (Sander et al., 2013; Wirth et al., 2016) and 
upper extremity maximum strength is of high importance 
for jumping and sprinting performance (Styles et al., 2016; 
Suchomel et al., 2016) as well as throwing performance 
(Hermassi et al., 2015), respectively. Enhanced strength 
has been associated with improved athletic performance in 
numerous sports, such as handball (Hermassi et al., 2015), 
basketball (Warneke et al., 2022a), soccer (Lohmann et al., 
2022), wrestling (McGuigan et al., 2006), boxing (Dunn et 
al., 2022), and swimming (Wirth et al., 2022). In addition, 
increased muscle strength contributes to injury prevention 
and rehabilitation (Østerås et al., 2015; Sommervold and 
Østerås, 2017). 
Frequently, upper body strength is measured and 
trained with the bench press (Lum et al., 2022; Young et 
al., 2015). Bench press training typically necessitates 
equipment such as barbells, weight plates and a bench. 
However, in phases of limited accessibility to equipment 
(e.g., pandemic lockdowns) or limited mobility (e.g., injuries), developing alternatives to common resistance training exercises to improve strength capabilities seems beneficial. Therefore, performing bodyweight training could be 
seen as an alternative, especially in health-related sports 
(Musick and Childs Cymet, 2006). Unfortunately, untrained individuals may not be able to adequately move 
their own bodyweight (e.g., full push-ups). 
Interestingly, high volume stretch training has been 
shown to provide sufficient muscle stimulation to induce 
maximum strength increases in humans (Arntz et al., 
2023), mostly measured in the plantar flexors (Nelson et 
al., 2012; Warneke et al., 2023a; Yahata et al., 2021) and 
in the pectoralis major (Reiner et al., 2023). 
Nevertheless, performing stretching with devices 
for about one hour per day limits the practical applicability 
(Schoenfeld et al., 2022). Furthermore, most of the available literature tested strength under isometric conditions in 
practically uncommon testing conditions (isolated movements) (Reiner et al., 2023; Warneke et al., 2023a). Since 
there are limitations when transferring results from isometric and isolated testing conditions to dynamic complex 
movements, with this study we aimed to investigate the effectivity of a home-based stretching program on pectoralis 
isometric and dynamic muscle strength and range of motion (ROM), to potentially enable the participants to stretch 
independent of location and time of the day. Based on prior 
publications (Arntz et al. 2023, Reiner et al., 2023), it was 
hypothesized that an increase in bench press strength and 
shoulder ROM would be observed in response to incorporating three different stretching exercises for 15min/day for 
eight weeks.

598 Stretch-induced strength and flexibility increases 
A priori sample size calculation was performed for the parameter of maximum isometric strength was performed using G-Power (Version 3.1) for F-tests with an assumed 
high effect size of f = 0.35 level for  - error of 0.5 (Warneke et al. 2022d) and estimated power of 1 -  error set at 
80% using two groups with two measurement points estimated a total sample size of at least 20 participants. Thirtyone (31) recreationally active participants were allocated 
into an IG (n = 18, m: 13, f: 5, age:25.17 ± 3.81 years, 
183.06 ± 7.24cm, 80.61 ± 13.4kg) and Control (n = 13, m: 
8, f: 5, 25.38 ± 3.38 years, 179.77 ± 8.65cm, 76.08 ± 
12.23kg). Participants were recruited from the university 
sports program and physical education classes, therefore, 
performing team or individual sports such as gymnastics or 
swimming at least twice per week regularly or fitness or 
resistance training in a gym for at least two days per week 
for the last six months. Group allocation was based on their 
willingness to participate, since numerous participants did 
not want to be included to the intervention group. Participants were excluded if they reported shoulder and/or chest 
pain, an injury of the upper limb within the last six months, 
if they did not participate in group fitness programs or university sports classes or changed their training routines 
(starting a new routine or stopping their previous training). 
The study was conducted under consideration of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study design was approved by 
the local ethical review board (Drs.EK/2022/064-01).
Experimental design 
To answer the research question, athletically active participants were allocated to an intervention group (IG) and a 
control group (Control). Stretching was performed 3x5 
minutes per day for eight weeks using three different exercises to stretch the pectoral musculature. Using a pre-posttest design, the effects on maximum strength using dynamic and isometric testing conditions were assessed. 
Since it is well known that stretch training leads to improved flexibility (Medeiros et al., 2016) flexibility adaptations in the shoulder were examined to check the effectiveness of the stretching intervention. Prior to testing, a 
familiarization session was performed to counteract habituation effects. 
Maximum strength testing 
Maximum strength was tested under dynamic conditions, 
testing the one repetition maximum (1RM), and under isometric conditions using a Smith machine. Before testing, a 
5- minute ergometer cycling at 1 kilopond and 2x5 pushups were performed to ensure a general warm up. 
One repetition maximum (1RM) testing 
The bench press 1RM was tested using the full ROM. 
Therefore, the participant was instructed to adopt a supine 
position on a training bench and the bar had to be lowered 
until the bar rested on the chest for one second. After reacting to an acoustic signal, the participant was instructed to 
push the weight as fast as possible to a fully extended elbow position. The weight was increased using 2.5kg steps 
until the participant failed to perform the repetition. Between each attempt, a rest of two minutes was ensured. To 
minimize the attempts to reach the maximum weight in the 
testing, the familiarization session was used to set a baseline value for the pre-test. Amarante do Nascimento et al. 
(2013) pointed out high reliability of 1RM strength testing 
in the bench press with intraclass coefficient correlations 
(ICC) up to 0.99. 
Maximum isometric testing 
Maximum isometric strength was tested with an elbow angle of 90°. The participant was positioned in a supine position on a training bench. The bar was fixed in the Smith 
machine to present an insurmountable resistance. Afterwards, the participant was instructed to perform a maximum voluntary contraction for three seconds. Trials were 
performed until no increase in the maximum strength value 
was observed, however, a minimum of three trials was performed. With an ICC of 0.89 - 0.97 a high reliability of 
isometric bench press testing can be assumed (Young et al., 
2014). 
Flexibility 
Shoulder ROM was tested using a straight wooden bar with 
a scale measuring the distance between the hands. The participant was instructed to hold the bar with extended elbows in front of the body and flex the shoulders as far as 
possible to move the bar over and behind the head and back 
respectively (see Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, 
no reliability values for this test could be found in literature, therefore ICC and CV were calculated in this study 
for the intra-day reliability (see Results section).

straight wooden bar with the scale to measure the distance 
between the hands 
Stretching intervention 
Participants were instructed to perform an eight-week 
home-based stretching program, using a gymnastic band 
with a resistance equal to 13.6 - 27.2 kg. Stretching was 
applied for 15 minutes by including three different exercises, each performed for five minutes. The three stretching 
variations are presented in Figures 2 a-c and were used to 
primarily stretch the pectoralis muscles. Participants were 
instructed to rest 30 seconds between the exercises. The order was chronologically determined as shown in Figure 2. 
The participants were instructed to perform the stretch 
training by using a 6 - 7 on a stretching visual analogue 
scale, as previously performed by Warneke et al. (2022c; 
2022d) and were instructed to document the training in a 
stretching diary.

to stretch the pectoralis muscle with straight arms pointing to the back with the elastic band as a resistance. The 
second stretch was performed with 90° elbow and shoulder angle, forearms pointing upwards, with the elastic 
band pulling from the back (shoulder external rotation) (b). The stretching exercise illustrated in (c) was performed in a supine position performing a fly movement with the arms, while the elastic band provides a resistance by holding in both hands with straight arms and shoulders externally rotated towards the ground.

Statistical analysis 
The analysis was performed with SPSS 28 (IBM, Armonk, 
New York, USA). Data is provided as mean (M) ± standard 
deviation (SD) for the pre-post values. The normal distribution of data was checked via Shapiro Wilk test. Reliability was determined using ICC, coefficient of variability and 
95% confidence interval (CI) for aforementioned tests. 
Moreover, Levene’s test for homogeneity in variance was 
performed. A t-test for independent values was used to rule 
out significant differences between IG and Control in pretest values. A 2 x 2 two-way ANOVA (2 conditions x 2 
times) with repeated measures was performed for data 
analyses of the pre-post comparisons for each parameter 
separately. Effect sizes are presented as Eta squares (ƞ²) 
and categorized as: small effect ƞ² < 0.06, medium effect 
ƞ² = 0.06 - 0.14, large effect ƞ² > 0.14 (Cohen, 1988). Additionally, effect sizes for in-between group mean differences from pre- to posttest were calculated. Considering 
the sample size differences between the IG and the Control, 
Hedges g was therefore calculated and categorized as: 
small effects g < 0.5, medium effect g = 0.5 - 0.8, large 
effect g > 0.8. The level of significance was set to p < 0.05. 
Results 
As instructed, participants stated that they performed their 
stretching exercises daily. Data were normally distributed 
(p = 0.112 - 0.659). No significant differences between the 
pre-test values between the IG and Control was detected 
with p = 0.094 - 0.66. For the isometric strength testing and 
ROM testing, there were high inter-day ICCs with 0.996 - 
0.999, CV = 0.06 ± 0.09 - 2.43 ± 3.1% and high intra-day 
ICCs of 0.997 - 0.998 and CV = 0.01 ± 0.03% - 1.8 ± 1.7%. 
No intra-day reliability was obtained for the bench press 
1RM since this was tested only once in the pre-test condition. However, the inter-day reliability also revealed high 
reliability with ICC = 0.987 and CV = 3.26 ± 3.9%. 
The results illustrated in Table 1 show significant, 
high magnitude strength and shoulder ROM increases with 
a Time effect in the 1RM and the ROM testing with p < 
0.001, ƞ² = 0.388 and p < 0.001, ƞ² = 0.582, respectively. 
Furthermore, both parameters showed a high magnitude, 
significant Group * Time interaction effect with p = 0.002, 
ƞ² = 0.281 and p < 0.001, ƞ² = 0.53, respectively. In the 
maximum isometric strength testing, a significant, high 
magnitude Time effect was found (p = 0.003, ƞ² = 0.271), 
however, the Time * Group interaction effect did not reach 
the level of significance (p = 0.754). The results are graphically illustrated in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5.

mean differences of the 1RM testing showed a high magnitude effect of g = 1.22, a trivial effect in isometric testing 
of g = 0.11 and a high magnitude effect of g = 4.67 in ROM

Discussion 
With significant increases in maximum (dynamic) bench 
press 1RM strength (7.4%) and shoulder ROM (9.8%), our 
results are (partially) in line with recently published research, showing significant stretch-induced maximum 
strength increases. Previously, plantar flexor muscles maximal dynamic strength demonstrated stretch-induced increases of up to 29% with intervention periods of up to 10 
weeks (Nelson et al., 2012; Warneke et al., 2022d). Previously, Reiner et al. (2023) performed a seven-week stretch 
training program, using three sessions per week performing three exercises with a stretching durations of five 
minutes per exercise, hence, the stretching volume was 
very similar to our study. However, they measured maximal voluntary isometric strength only, showing strength increases of up to 15%. Even though we measured a maximum isometric strength improvement of about 12%, the 
control group also significantly increased their isometric 
maximum strength 9.3%, leading to a lack of Time*Group 
interaction. Assuming not all people may be accustomed to 
isometric training and testing conditions (Drake et al., 
2018; Warneke et al., 2023d), it can be hypothesized that 
habituation effects induced increases in the control group. 
Although we attempted to check potential learning effects 
by previously performing habituation/familiarization sessions showing high inter-day reliability, our results underline the limited value of isometric testing devices, since unfamiliar testing condition, muscle length- and joint angle 
specificity as well as exercise dependent conditions must 
be considered, leading to partially conflicting results 
(Drake et al., 2018; Warneke et al., 2023d). Discrepancies 
between isometric and dynamic testing conditions can be 
reviewed in Wirth (2007), investigating the effects of a dynamic resistance training program on isometric and dynamic maximum strength. With dynamic testing, five out 
of six testing conditions revealed a significant strength increase, while with isometric testing, they reported a significant training-induced performance enhancement in just 
one test, highlighting the relevance of specific testing conditions. Therefore, the lack of interaction effect in our 
study under isometric testing conditions is even more surprising, as the intervention was static stretching and not a 
dynamic training condition, which thus would have anticipated a higher effect in isometric testing conditions. Furthermore, the wide dispersion of the individual mean differences, (Figure 5) show an inconsistency in adaptations 
with a mean increase of 12.1%  22.3%, which could possibly be attributed to an inability to produce a consistent 
force output, because of unfamiliar testing conditions. In 
line with this theory, the dynamic results show higher consistency with only one participant showing a decrease in 
maximum strength. 
Still, the question arises about the underlying mechanisms of stretch-mediated strength increases. While flexibility increases are mainly attributed to neuromuscular 
changes, such as enhanced pain or stretch threshold 
(Freitas et al., 2018) and/or muscle tendon unit stiffness 
changes (Takeuchi et al., 2023), the physiology of stretchmediated strength increases remains still speculative. On 
the one hand, it is well known that muscle hypertrophy 
contributes to enhanced maximal strength (Goldspink and 
Harridge, 2003). Even though stretching has shown the potential to induce hypertrophy when using one to two hours 
of stretching, other experimental studies performing 
stretching for up to 20 minutes per session (Wohlann et al., 
2023) nor systematic review (Nunes et al., 2020; Panidi et 
al., 2023) were able to point out significant muscle hypertrophy. Additionally, in the present study, we did not perform muscle volume measurements. 
Since previous studies pointed out contralateral 
strength increases (Nelson et al., 2012; Panidi et al., 2021; 
Warneke et al., 2022b; 2022d) the involvement of neuronal 
training adaptation in response to stretching seems evident. 
While Holly et al. (1980) and Barnett et al. (1980) investigated the effects of stretching on EMG activity in animals 
showing no significantly enhanced neuronal activity, no 
studies were detected testing neuromuscular activity while 
performing stretching in humans. Furthermore, changes in 
reflex responses, changed activation patterns due to familiarization to stretching pain in higher muscle lengths or 
changes in neuromuscular activity due to changes in contraction properties (changes in fascicle angle/length, (Panidi et al., 2023)) could also be hypothesized. The commonly reported increase in stretch/pain threshold with 
ROM increases may also apply to strength gains, as individuals may be able to sustain greater discomfort when lifting/contracting and thus push harder (higher intensity contractions) with the suppression of pain. While there are 
some promising explanatory approaches when interpreting 
stretch-mediated strength increases (Warneke, et al., 
2023b), there is still a lack of investigations exploring the 
underlying physiology. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear to this point. 
Furthermore, it is well known from previous research, that (static) stretching performed for a duration of 
several weeks commonly induces flexibility increases 
(Konrad et al. 2023). Accordingly, the stretch training 
showed significant increases in shoulder ROM. While not 
investigated in the present study, the literature suggests 
possible morphological and neurological mechanisms for 
the chronic stretch training-induced improvements in 
ROM. Five to six weeks of stretch training has been found 
to decrease muscle and tendon stiffness (Behm et al. 2016), 
although not in all studies (Freitas et al., 2018; Kubo et al.,
2002; Mahieu et al., 2007), reduce tendon viscoelastic 
properties (Kubo et al., 2002), and muscle passive resistive 
602 Stretch-induced strength and flexibility increases 
torque (Mahieu et al., 2007). Neuronal or psychophysiological adaptations such as changes in stretch tolerance by 
increasing the pain threshold (Freitas et al., 2018; Konrad 
and Tilp, 2014) is a ubiquitously proposed underlying 
mechanism. With the vast extent of research focusing on 
ROM adaptations in response to stretching, this study did 
not focus on the underlying mechanisms of stretch traininginduced increases in flexibility. 
Limitations 
First, sex-distribution was not balanced. Since Warneke et 
al. (2022c) described sex-related differences in stretch-mediated adaptations the results could be therefore influenced 
significantly. Furthermore, in the final data analysis, the 
sample size in IG and Control were not completely balanced. The results of the study are limited by providing 
only phenomenological results without evaluating underlying physiological parameters such as hypertrophy, passive 
stiffness, pain threshold or changes in the neuromuscular 
activation. Since literature regarding stretch-mediated 
strength increases is scarce, potential long-term issues regarding overstretching the shoulder joint were not reported 
in this study, however, they might occur by increasing the 
intensity and/or stretching duration. Therefore, potential 
risks should be considered carefully in further studies, especially if participants are not familiar with using the full 
ROM in the shoulder joint. 
Conclusion
Significant, large magnitude increases in maximum (dynamic) bench press 1RM strength (7.4%) and shoulder 
ROM (9.8%) were documented following static stretching 
of the pectoralis major for 15min/day for eight weeks, incorporating three different stretching exercises. Since 
Schoenfeld et al. (2022) questioned the practical applications of using one hour of daily stretching to induce hypertrophy and previous studies pointed out the demand for further studies with the transferability to other muscle groups 
(Warneke et al., 2022b; 2022d), a home-based training program was developed to improve the application of improving maximum strength via stretching. To clarify, the authors do not recommend the replacement of strength training to increase muscle mass or maximum strength, especially considering the comparably prolonged time to induce comparable results via stretching (Warneke et al., 
2023c). Nevertheless, the results point out a possible alternative to those individuals, who are not willing to, do not 
have access to strength training equipment or are less 
trained and therefore not able to perform bodyweight training. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that these 
strength adaptations occurred with an unsupervised, at 
home program. Whether stretch training could induce 
enough tension to improve maximum strength significantly 
in various populations (e.g., previously trained or athletes) 
should be investigated in further studies, especially since 
Li et al. (2022) showed that stretching only improved performance in low performance level individuals. 
Outlook 
Research in the future should investigate the underlying 
mechanisms of stretch-induced stretching increases, including neuromuscular adaptations by performing EMGmeasurements as well as structural changes of the muscle, 
tendon and muscle-tendon-complex. As Schoenfeld et al. 
(2022) suggested the inclusion of interest stretch to enhance hypertrophy adaptations, the combination of longduration stretching interventions with the potential of inducing muscle hypertrophy and commonly used exercise 
interventions such as resistance training should be investigated in further studies.
