Abstract
Background: Current diagnostic systems for mental disorders rely upon presenting signs and symptoms, with the
result that current definitions do not adequately reflect relevant neurobiological and behavioral systems - impeding
not only research on etiology and pathophysiology but also the development of new treatments.
Discussion: The National Institute of Mental Health began the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project in 2009 to
develop a research classification system for mental disorders based upon dimensions of neurobiology and
observable behavior. RDoC supports research to explicate fundamental biobehavioral dimensions that cut across
current heterogeneous disorder categories. We summarize the rationale, status and long-term goals of RDoC,
outline challenges in developing a research classification system (such as construct validity and a suitable process
for updating the framework) and discuss seven distinct differences in conception and emphasis from current
psychiatric nosologies.
Summary: Future diagnostic systems cannot reflect ongoing advances in genetics, neuroscience and cognitive
science until a literature organized around these disciplines is available to inform the revision efforts. The goal of
the RDoC project is to provide a framework for research to transform the approach to the nosology of mental
disorders.

Background
As of this writing, there are three versions of diagnostic
systems for psychiatry in development. By far the most notoriety has been attached to the revision of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association, which has
been under revision sufficiently long enough to receive a
name change from DSM-V to DSM-5. This attention is
not surprising given the prominence of the DSM for clinical diagnosis both in the US and internationally, its simultaneous role in research, and the number of controversial
issues that have been involved in the revision process -
such as the debates over autism spectrum disorder [1], bereavement and depression [2], and personality disorders
[3,4], to name just a few. The DSM revisions have also
prompted an extensive re-visiting of important issues
regarding the nature of mental disorders, and how they
should be considered scientifically. An excellent summary
and analysis of these topics is represented by the series of
papers that appeared recently in Philosophy, Ethics, and
Humanities in Medicine and BMC Medicine ([5-7]; see
also [8]).
The second major revision is that of the Mental and Behavioural Disorders section of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), being developed by the World
Health Organization. This revision effort is being accomplished by an international group of experts, including
some intentional overlap with members from the DSM
committees. (It is worth noting that the ICD represents
the official diagnostic standard in the US as in the rest of
the world.) Although both the DSM and ICD emphasize
clinical utility, the scope of the clinical settings where the
ICD is employed tends to be yet more varied and extensive than that of the DSM. The latter is intended largely
for use by highly trained mental health professionals
(though it is employed by many professional groups). By
contrast, the ICD is necessarily designed for health

settings around the world, to be used not only by practitioners with widely divergent levels of expertise but also in
cultural settings where assumptions about the etiology
and nature of disorders may be highly dissimilar from the
Western milieu of the DSM. Accordingly, the ICD places
stronger emphasis on public health applications than the
DSM, and one reflection of this emphasis is the use of definitions that emphasize short text descriptions of each disorder rather than the polythetic symptom lists of the DSM.
Finally, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
instituted the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project
in early 2009. Given its status as a research classification
system rather than one intended for routine clinical use,
this initiative diverges markedly from the others in multiple respects. The seven major differences between RDoC
and the established systems are delineated in the sections
that follow, as its share of this forum.
One caveat is in order at the outset to provide an appropriate context for the remarks that follow. The dictionary
reminds us that the first sense of the noun ‘debate’ is
‘a discussion ... involving opposing viewpoints,’ as appropriate for its Latin root that means ‘to beat’ [9]. However,
discussions among the framers of the DSM-5, the ICD-11
revisions and the NIMH RDoC have from their inception
been cordial, and marked by general agreement about the
relative emphasis of each respective system and also about
their shared interests. Thus - unfortunately from the perspective of sparking a sharp exchange among divergent
views - the ‘debate’ in this case must proceed more along
the lines of the term’s more elaborated definition, a ‘deliberation’ or ‘consideration.’ In this more congenial sense,
there is indeed much to consider.
Discussion
A diagnostic system can have many purposes. For instance, a major reason for the creation of the ICD was
to establish a comprehensive manual for determining
causes of mortality, thus enhancing efforts at improving
public health. However, perhaps the pre-eminent role of
diagnosis in medicine is to determine the exact nature of
a patient’s disease in order to administer the optimal
treatment. Yet, very little discussion of this aspect can
be found either in published papers or in the extensive
‘blogosphere’ that has sprung up around the DSM-5.
The revisions have renewed debates about the definition
and nature of mental disorders; the various positions in
the philosophy of science that might represent how to
think about mental illness (‘realist,’ ‘essentialist,’ and so
on); categorical versus dimensional approaches to disorders; and the role of reductionism and phenomenology
[5-8]. Any discussion about the ramifications of these
various considerations in actually making a difference on
how we treat our patients, however, has been conspicuously lacking.
This lack is likely due in no small part to the current nature of treatments for mental disorders. On the one hand,
effective treatments exist. Treatments for major classes of
disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are available, and effective
for large numbers of patients. Further, a number of effective treatment modalities - pharmaceutical interventions,
psychosocial or behavioral treatments, medical devices -
have been established. On the other hand, treatments are
not particularly precise, and tend to affect broad classes of
disorders. Anti-depressant medications, such as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are used to treat not only
depression but a wide variety of anxiety, mood and other
disorders. Anti-psychotic agents are used not only with
schizophrenia but in bipolar disorder and sometimes for
personality and other severe disorders. Anxiolytics such as
valium are prescribed widely across the anxiety and mood
spectrum. A similar situation prevails for behavioral treatments; for instance, the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy, albeit with many variants, has expanded beyond the
internalizing disorders spectrum for which it was originally developed to the treatment of virtually all mental
disorders (for example, see [10]).
Although decent treatments for mental disorders are
thus plentiful, it is instructive to contrast the changes in
disease burden for other diseases over the past several
decades with that for mental disorders. For instance, the
impact of research - both clinically and in public health
arenas - has been dramatic for heart disease. Death due
to heart disease climbed steadily from 1950 through
1968, at a rate that projected almost 1.8 million deaths
in 2007. Instead, because of the rapid progress of research, the actual mortality due to heart disease was only
about one quarter of that number; approximately 1.1
million deaths in 2007 alone were averted according to
the predicted peak rate [11]. Similarly, survival rates for
children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have improved over the last several decades from less than 10%
to over 90% [12]. By contrast, mortality has not decreased for any mental illness, prevalence rates are similarly unchanged [13], there are no clinical tests for
diagnosis, detection of disorders is delayed well beyond
generally accepted onset of pathology, and there are no
well-developed preventive interventions.
There are many reasons for this lack of progress in mental disorders. The brain is the most complex organ in the
body, and it is well-accepted that mental illnesses involve
highly complex interactions of genetic factors and experience. The brain cannot be studied directly with the facility
we have for more accessible organs, limiting progress
based on pathology. However, the diagnostic system for
psychiatry has also been increasingly noted as an impediment to progress. The problems have been extensively
documented (for example, [14-18]) and do not need to be

elaborated here, but include excessive co-morbidity of disorders, marked heterogeneity of mechanisms and reification of disorders. In particular, the underlying validity of
the disease entities has been questioned, in that the DSM
and ICD categories do not map well onto emerging findings from genetics, systems neuroscience and behavioral
science (for example, [19,20]); as a result, it becomes very
difficult to translate research from basic studies, either in
animal models or in humans, to a systematic understanding of pathology or to systematic treatments directed at
mechanisms. Nevertheless, the DSM and ICD system (the
two nosologies are largely overlapping in terms of the
actual listing of disorders) has become the standard to
obtain research grants regarding etiology and pathophysiology, to conduct drug trials at all phases, and to obtain
regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical treatments. In behavioral research as well, the need to establish evidencebased treatments has led researchers to copy the lead of
drug trials and conduct trials in terms of DSM and ICD
diagnoses. Thus, issues with the current nosology markedly affect the treatment development arena.
This point is well illustrated in a quotation from a recent
paper by several pharmaceutical industry scientists regarding problems in drug development using the current system: ‘On average, a marketed psychiatric drug is efficacious
in approximately half of the patients who take it. One reason for this low response rate is the artificial grouping of
heterogeneous syndromes with different pathophysiological
mechanisms into one disorder ... by increasing the mechanistic understanding of disease and matching the right
treatments to the right patients, one could move from onesize-fits-all to targeted therapy and increase the benefit-risk
ratio for patients.’ These scientists conclude that a ‘pedestrian’ trial-and-error search of multi-target agents must be
hazarded ‘... until clinical trial design and patient segmentation can improve to the point of matching disease
phenotype to circuit-based deficits...’ ([21], p. 1276). This
problem is no doubt a not insignificant reason why so
many pharmaceutical companies have withdrawn from active development research in mental disorders [22,23].
And the reliance on biologically heterogeneous categories
as the gold standard for diagnosis has clearly precluded
the identification or validation of biomarkers. Although
one could imagine revising the diagnostic categories to
align with biological discoveries, our field has essentially
excluded biological findings that do not map on to the
current heterogeneous categories of symptom clusters.
In other areas of medicine, trends have increasingly
moved in the direction of ever more precise specification
of the genetic, molecular and cellular aspects of disease.
In specialty after specialty, there has been a realization
that disease entities that appear to be a single disorder
actually have distinct genetic precursors and pathophysiology. For instance, for many forms of cancer, diagnosis
is no longer defined by the involved organ or even the
pathologist’s report, but rather by analysis of genetic
variants that can predict exactly what treatment will be
optimal (for example, [24]). In another domain, perhaps
the most striking example of this trend involves a new
drug, Ivacaftor (Kalydeco), approved by the Food and
Drug Administration after an expedited review. The
drug is effective in treating patients with cystic fibrosis
who have a form of the syndrome with a specific mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene.
Only 4% of patients with cystic fibrosis have this genetic
mutation, but, for these patients, the compound is highly
effective in correcting the action of the malfunctioning
protein [25].
These new approaches toward individualized treatment
are now generally called ‘precision medicine’, and represent the forefront of medical science. In November 2011,
the US National Academy of Sciences published a major
report on precision medicine outlining the significance of
this development and calling for new knowledge networks
that can harness the power of promising technologies to
identify and correct specific pathophysiologies that result
from genetic and environmental causes [26]. As yet, the
field of mental disorders research lags badly behind the
rest of medicine in moving toward precision medicine;
yet, knowledge of the central nervous system has exploded
over the last two decades, and new technologies are rapidly eclipsing such well-known methods as positron emission tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging.
How can these rapid developments in basic science be
harnessed in the service of precision medicine for mental
disorders?
Research domain criteria
As a national health ministry, NIMH is committed to reducing the burden of suffering due to mental illness through
research. Decades of research have increasingly revealed
that neural circuits and systems are a critical factor in how
the brain is organized and functions, and how genetics and
epigenetics exert their influence. However, this knowledge
cannot be implemented in clinical studies as readily as
might be hoped. Any one mechanism, such as fear circuits
or working memory, is implicated in multiple disorders as
currently defined; it is difficult to know which diagnostic
category to select first to explore any promising leads, and
a positive result immediately raises the question of whether
the demonstration of efficacy must be extended to all similar disorders (a time-consuming and expensive proposition). Contrariwise, a syndrome such as major depression
clearly involves multiple mechanisms - dysfunction in the
hypothalamic pituitary axis, in brain reward-seeking activities, in emotion regulation circuits, in modulatory neurotransmitter systems, in cognitive systems, and in epigenetic
marks; thus, it is not surprising that studies to establish
Cuthbert and Insel BMC Medicine 2013, 11:126 Page 3 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/126
‘the cause’ of major depression are equivocal and difficult
to replicate, nor that new treatments directed toward a
particular mechanism are often only marginally effective
and cannot be replicated.
In response to this situation, NIMH established in its
Strategic Plan of 2008 the following goal: to ‘develop, for
research purposes, new ways of classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and
neurobiological measures.’ The instantiation of this goal
is the RDoC project, and is NIMH’s effort to develop a
precision medicine approach for mental disorders [27].
RDoC represents a real paradigm shift, by considering
mental disorders from a translational point of view.
RDoC does not take as a starting point the traditional
view of disorders as symptom complexes based largely
on clinical descriptions. Rather, the approach proceeds
in two steps. The first step is to inventory the fundamental, primary behavioral functions that the brain has
evolved to carry out, and to specify the neural systems
that are primarily responsible for implementing these
functions. For instance, much is now known about circuits for fear and defense [28], for various aspects of appetitive behavior such as learning to predict reward and
moving toward reward [29], and cognitive functions
such as working memory [30]. The second step then involves a consideration of psychopathology in terms of
dysfunction of various kinds and degrees in particular
systems, as studied from an integrative, multi-systems
point of view.
The four aims of the RDoC project are listed in
Table 1, beneath the statement of goal 1.4. The project
began with deliberations among members of an internal
NIMH working group, which served to define the overall
shape of the effort as well as the specific process to be
followed. The workgroup determined that the optimal approach was to establish a hierarchical scheme, with the
specific dimensions nested within five major domains of
functioning (see Table 2 for a listing of the RDoC matrix
as of June, 2012 at the end of the initial conference series).
The project moved forward rapidly once this organizational matrix was established. As called for Aim 1 of
Table 1, the RDoC process involved a series of workshops
with experts in the field to determine the ‘fundamental behavioral components’ to be included in the system. The
five major domains, conceived on empirical grounds from
such diverse research areas as temperament, behavior genetics and structural models of mental disorders, also
served as a convenient way to organize the workshops in
that one workshop was conducted for each of the five domains. Approximately 30 to 40 experts convened for each
workshop. Their charge was to determine which dimensions should be included within the domain; provide a
definition for each dimension; and provide a list of the elements for each dimension that could be used to measure
it, at each of several units of analysis (as specified in Aim
4 of Table 1). An important consideration is that the dimensions, as behavioral entities tied to neural systems, are
always dependent upon the march of research to continually refine and evolve a scientific understanding of their
function and of their implementing circuits. In this sense,
the dimensions represent ‘constructs’ as classically defined
in psychological research [31], and this term was adopted
for RDoC to emphasize that they will (and should) always
be subject to further validation and revision. The RDoC
‘matrix’ thus consists of a series of rows, with the constructs nested within their superordinate domains, and
the columns representing the units of analysis. The
reader is encouraged to consult the RDoC website
(http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/rdoc/index.
shtml), which contains the completed matrices from all
of the RDoC workshops.
The seven pillars
The distinctions between RDoC and the DSM and ICD
systems can be captured by seven major points that
include both conceptual and practical differences. First,
the approach incorporates a strong translational research
perspective. Rather than starting with symptom-based
definitions of disorders and working toward their pathophysiology, RDoC inverts this process. Basic science - in
genetics, other areas of neuroscience and behavioral
science -serves as the starting point, and disorders are
considered in terms of disruptions of the normal-range
operation of these systems, with an emphasis on the
mechanisms that serve to result in dysfunctions of varying
degrees.
Second, RDoC incorporates an explicitly dimensional
approach to psychopathology, as called for in many recent
analyses of psychopathology [32,33]. However, in contrast

classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of

Aim # Task
1 Initiate a process for bringing together experts in clinical and
basic sciences to jointly identify the fundamental behavioral
components that may span multiple disorders (e.g., executive
functioning, affect regulation, person perception) and that
are more amenable to neuroscience approaches.
2 Determine the full range of variation, from normal to
abnormal, among the fundamental components to improve
understanding of what is typical versus pathological.
3 Develop reliable and valid measures of these fundamental
components of mental disorders for use in basic studies and
in more clinical settings.
4 Integrate the fundamental genetic, neurobiological,
behavioral, environmental, and experiential components that
comprise these mental disorders.
Cuthbert and Insel BMC Medicine 2013, 11:126 Page 4 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/126
to views that emphasize dimensionality mostly as a function of symptom severity, RDoC is committed to studying
the ‘full range of variation, from normal to abnormal.’ In
some cases, only one end of a dimension may involve
problem behavior (for instance, one is seldom likely to
complain of an outstanding memory or keen vision), but
often both extremes of a dimension may be considered as
‘abnormal’ – for example, a complete lack of fear may be
associated with aggressive or psychopathic behavior, and
the opposite end of diminished reward-seeking may be
mania. An important consideration regarding dimensionality is that the relationship between increasing disruptions in functional mechanisms and the severity of
symptoms may be markedly nonlinear, with ‘tipping
points’ that mark a transition to more severe pathology; a
critical area of research is to determine the exact location
of such points, and how they are affected in each individual by various risk or resilience factors.
The third distinction follows directly from the second.
Aim 3 in Table 1 includes a call to ‘Develop reliable and
valid measures of these fundamental components.’ One
of the drawbacks of a pathogen model of illness is that
most scales developed over the past decades have either
been designed to study normal traits such as personality
or else clinical symptoms of disorder, and thus lack sensitivity at one end or the other of a putative dimension.
In particular, zones of very mild or transient psychopathology, with their potential for understanding proximate
etiology and for indicated prevention, receive short
shrift. Thus, scale development represents a high priority
for RDoC research applications. In fact, well-validated
and psychometrically optimized measures based upon
cognitive neuroscience research are beginning to appear
[34]. Consistent with contemporary measurement science,
new scales would (and should) almost invariably incorporate interval or ratio scaling to improve quantification of
the phenomena of interest. As such assessments muster,
it becomes feasible to determine cut-points along the
distribution for varying types of interventions, essentially
similar to practices in other areas of medicine where continuous measures are available, such as hypertension or
hypercholesterolemia. A further advantage of this approach is that ongoing research studies about relative risk
at various points along the dimension can inform decisions about changing the cut-points at which interventions are indicated - as has happened repeatedly, such as
in hypertension research [35].
The fourth distinction concerns the types of designs and
sampling strategies that RDoC studies must necessarily
follow. In the traditional clinical study, the independent variable is almost always one or more (usually one)
DSM or ICD groups, often versus controls. It is relatively
straightforward to diagnose the patients according to the
symptom-based criteria, excluding those who fail to meet
criteria for the diagnosis under study. The resultant
groups form the independent (grouping) variable. (An important public health issue concerns the unknown number of such patients whose conditions are essentially
invisible to research by virtue of failing to meet criteria, although it is well known that for some disorders, such as
eating disorders, ‘not otherwise specified’ is the modal
diagnosis.) RDoC, by contrast, involves a two-step procedure. The investigator must first establish the ‘sampling
frame,’ that is, what group of individuals will be entered
into the study; because this will not be identical to a DSM
or ICD diagnosis, other criteria will have to be applied. In
some cases, this might simply comprise all patients presenting at a certain type of clinic, such as for anxiety disorders or serious mental illness. However, such a sampling
frame might fail to meet the goal of studying the ‘full
range,’ and so a control group might also be needed - with
a wider range of inclusion, however, rather than the typical
‘super-normal’ control group with no psychiatric history.
Then, the second step is to specify the independent variable in the study. To permit investigators freedom in pursuing their hypotheses, the independent variable may be
chosen from any unit of analysis. Thus, performance on a
working memory task might be the independent variable

for a study of working memory in serious mental illness;
dependent variables might comprise neuroimaging of
specified brain areas, relevant assessments of real-world
dysfunction and an exploration of relevant candidate
genes. For a study of anxiety disorders, fear-potentiated
startle might be the independent variable, stratified by a
relevant genetic polymorphism, and the dependent variables could be overall symptom severity and distress plus
performance on a behavioral fear-avoidance test. Thus,
while more interesting research designs can be created,
the investigator will need to be more thoughtful about
crafting the design of the study to answer the particular
experimental question.
Fifth, and critically important, the system is intended
to provide a structure that places equal weight on behavioral functions and upon neural circuits and their constituent elements - that is, to be an integrative model
rather than one based primarily on either behavior or
neuroscience. This integrative approach can be seen in
the way in which goal 1.4 is stated. The criterion for including a construct in the matrix during the workshops
reflects this same priority. Participants were instructed
that there were two requirements for adding a construct
to the matrix: first, ‘There must be strong evidence for
the validity of the suggested construct itself [as a behavioral function]’; second, ‘There must be strong evidence
that the suggested construct maps onto a specific biological system, such as a brain circuit.’ This rule was
carefully followed; over the course of the workshop
series, there were several instances where a nominated
construct was not included either because a nominated
function could not be paired with an implementing
neural system, or because a consensus could not be
reached regarding the function of a nominated circuit.
The NIMH working group’s shorthand expression for
this idea was, ‘Behavioral science studies what the brain
evolved to do, and neuroscience studies how the brain
implements it.’ Thus, claims that the RDoC system simply involves biomarkers or endophenotypes are oversimplified at best.
Following from this consideration, a sixth distinction
is that the RDoC project is intended (at its inception, in
particular) to concentrate on constructs for which there
is solid evidence to serve as a platform for ongoing research. There is no claim to include all of the psychopathology that is listed in the various categories of the
DSM and ICD nosologies. This reflects a deliberate decision by NIMH to constrain the initial scope of the project to elements for which there is considerable data, so
as to provide a solid foundation on which to gain experience and indicate how more provisional constructs may
be studied profitably in the future.
Finally, a research-oriented scheme like RDoC faces
both a luxury and a risk in not being tied to fixed
definitions of disorders. As many commentators have
pointed out, any changes to DSM or ICD criteria prompt
considerable upheaval throughout the mental health system - in officially reported prevalence rates, in possible insurance reimbursement changes, in legal proceedings and
declarations of disability, in regulatory practice. As an experimental classification, RDoC does not face these liabilities. In fact, a strong goal of a research system ought to
be its flexibility in dynamically accommodating those research advances that it tries to foster. Provision must be
made to delete constructs that have been superseded by
new thinking, to add constructs, to split one construct
into two, and so on. (The NIMH RDoC workgroup has
actively considered the optimal process for considering
such changes, which will be disseminated in the near future.) As this consideration implies, and in contrast to
clinical nosologies, the constructs appearing in the RDoC
matrix (Table 2) are not the only ones that can be studied.
A new construct can be added to the matrix only when
replicated data are furnished to provide evidence that it
meets the two criteria indicated above (a validated construct, and a specifiable neural circuit); it follows that such
studies could not be conducted if only those constructs
listed in the RDoC matrix were permitted for study. Thus,
a critical component of RDoC is to permit research involving well-justified experiments seeking to validate constructs that are not currently part of the RDoC matrix, or
to modify in various ways the extant constructs.
Summary
Psychiatry lags behind other areas of medicine in building avenues toward a precision medicine approach to
diagnosis, and will not catch up until a system is available that reflects recent progress in genetics, other areas
of neuroscience and behavioral science. However, such a
system cannot be implemented until a database is available that can inform its development. This is the essential rationale for the RDoC project. It is difficult to
estimate how long such a project may take. Already,
promising developments are being forged by investigators who have probed the circuits from both basic and
clinical directions, and have related these findings to
well-validated tasks that measure functioning. However,
the integrative approach that RDoC calls for is so new
that unforeseen obstacles surely await the pioneers in
this area. This is only to be expected. In the long run,
there seems to be a growing consensus in the field that a
more empirically based approach must be developed,
and the inherent qualities of the research process itself
should serve to shape mid-course corrections as the project moves forward. It should be re-iterated, however,
that the RDoC framework is explicitly intended to be a
moving target, and that the framework should grow and
change with the pace of new research findings. Thus, the
Cuthbert and Insel BMC Medicine 2013, 11:126 Page 6 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/126
challenge is not to design an optimal list of relatively
permanent elements, but rather to construct a platform
that can both accommodate and foster continual developments in research knowledge and methods.
It will be quite apparent to the reader that RDoC is
neither designed nor intended to be used for practical
clinical purposes at this early stage. The near-term goal of
RDoC, rather, is to build a new framework of research that
can produce pioneering new findings and approaches to
inform future versions of psychiatric nosologies. In particular, the goal is to lay the groundwork for specifying
how diagnosticians can accomplish the goal of precision
medicine for mental disorders - pinpointing with increasing accuracy the precise genetic, neural circuit and behavioral data that can generate tailored recommendations for
interventions that can manage, cure and prevent mental
disorders in the largest possible number of individuals. In
this sense, although the immediate thrust of the RDoC
