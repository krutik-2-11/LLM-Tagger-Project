The present study investigated the efect of urban (trafc noise) vs. natural (birdsongs) soundscapes
on mood, state paranoia, and cognitive performance, hypothesizing that birdsongs lead to signifcant
improvements in these outcomes. An additional goal was to explore the diferential impact of
lower vs. higher diversity of the soundscapes by manipulating the number of diferent typical trafc
sounds or songs of diferent bird species within the respective soundscapes. In a randomized online
experiment, N= 295 participants were exposed to one out of four conditions for 6 min: trafc noise
low, trafc noise high, birdsong low, and birdsong high diversity soundscapes. Before and after the
exposure, participants performed a digit-span and dual n-back task, and flled out depression, anxiety,
and paranoia questionnaires. The trafc noise soundscapes were associated with a signifcant increase
in depression (small efect size in low, medium efect size in high diversity condition). Concerning the
birdsong conditions, depression exclusively decreased after exposure to the high diversity soundscape
(small efect size). Anxiety and paranoia signifcantly decreased in both birdsong conditions (medium
efect sizes). For cognition, no efects were observed. In sum, the present study suggests that
listening to birdsongs regardless of diversity improves anxiety, while trafc noise, also regardless of
diversity, is related to higher depressiveness. Moreover, for the frst time, benefcial, medium-sized
efects of birdsong soundscapes were demonstrated, reducing paranoia. Overall, the results bear
interesting implications for further research, such as actively manipulating soundscapes in diferent
environments or settings (e.g., psychiatric wards) and testing their efect on subclinical or even clinical
manifestations of anxiety and paranoia.
Te impact of environmental infuences on psychological well-being and cognition in humans have for a long
time been neglected in traditional psychology. At present, human living environments are changing drastically.
According to the UN 2007 was a turning point for humankind as for the frst time the majority of the global
population lived in urban areas1

. Until 2050, it is estimated that 68% of the world population will be living

in cities2
. In Europe the urbanization rate is already as high as 75%. Urbanization coincides with increasing
rates of mental illness. An earlier review from 2005 came to the conclusion that about 30% of the incidence
in schizophrenia may be attributed to urban factors in interaction with genetic liability and social adversity3
.

A meta-analysis4

shows a link between the increase of schizophrenia incidence and the increase in urbanicity,
highlighting the fact that the risk for schizophrenia in the most urban environment was estimated to be 2.37
times higher than in the most rural environment. In a study investigating environmental factors known to trigger
paranoia5
, it was shown that urban cyclers commonly report to experience at least one state paranoia reaction,
reported on a paranoia scale, in response to what the authors call an interpersonal threat situation. Tis was
caused by the presence of potentially dangerous trafc participants, such as motor vehicle drivers. According to
Ellet et al.5
the key environmental factors known to trigger paranoia include threat and ambiguity, which may
be more ofen found in urban compared to natural environments. A recent review on depression and urbanicity
reported mixed results, however with the majority of studies suggesting an elevated risk of depression in more
(vs. less) urbanized areas6

. Concerning mood and anxiety disorders, a review on studies conducted in Europe
concludes that most studies showed elevated risks for mood/anxiety symptoms when comparing some (albeit
not all) of the urban to rural areas7

. In sum, there is hence accumulating evidence that living in urban areas is

related to worse mental health outcomes.

Contrary to the negative efect of urban environments on mental health, a recent study shows that increasing
access to total and usable green space within the neighborhood can decrease anxiety/mood disorder treatment

counts. Tis demonstrates the service that urban green spaces may provide for general mental health and well-
being8

. Another study, which looked at the perceived sensory dimensions (PSD) relevant for attentional and
stress recovery in green spaces, found that natural environments which are serene, provide refuge, and are rich
in species diversity, as well as are perceived as highly ‘natural’, are rated as most restful9

. Tese efects are ofen

explained by two predominant theories. Stress reduction theory (SRT) posits that landscapes, containing vegeta-
tion, water and other aspects that provide benefts for survival, help to moderate and reduce states of arousal and

negative thoughts and thus reduce the psychological and physiological symptoms of stress10. Similarly, Attention

Restoration Teory (ART) states that stimuli from natural sources restore cognitive function by reducing atten-
tion demands of the endogenous attention system11.

Experimental research in the feld has so far predominantly studied visuo-spatial aspects of the environment
concerning mental health efects, such as by using photographs, videos, slideshows, or other visual stimuli. Other
sensory modalities have been much less studied12. Man-made (urban) soundscapes (the so-called anthrophone)
can constitute constant stressors that may impair cognitive function and well-being. Urban noise contains salient
stimuli that likely trigger an alert physiological and psychological state. Corroborating this notion, a systematic

review on trafc noise exposure found consistent evidence for an association between trafc noise and depres-
sion, as well as cognitive decline13. On the other hand, natural soundscapes, which are typically characterized

by birdsongs, wind, or water12, could be an important source of attention-restorative and stress-ameliorating
efects, as they might be implicitly associated with a safe and vital natural environment. As documented by a
narrative review, birdsongs, water-, and wind-sounds have been shown to be perceived as pleasant, and to have
benefcial efects on mood, arousal levels, and cognitive performance12. Importantly, in several studies that have
reported positive efects of birds on human well-being, higher species diversity was a relevant factor14, perhaps
because it may indicate the vitality or intactness of natural spaces. In a study across 26 countries conducted by
Methorst et al.15, the authors established a relationship between species diversity of birds within a region and
self-reported life satisfaction of residents of those regions. Remarkably, it was found that a 10% increase in bird
species diversity raises life-satisfaction approx. 1.53 times more than a proportional rise in income15.
In a randomized controlled experimental study using auditory stimuli, hypotheses derived from ART and SRT
were tested. Van Hedger et al.16 compared a nature vs. city soundscape condition, whereby the former enhanced
participants’ performance in a dual n-back and digit span task, but did not improve mood. Te present study
broadly builds on the study by van Hedger et al.16 but adds the factor of diversity to the soundscapes. In addition

to mood and cognition (dual n-back and digit span task), the present study additionally focusses on state para-
noia, as this is a very prominent symptom in psychosis which can be measured in a change-sensitive manner17.

Furthermore, state paranoia has been shown to increase in response to trafc noise (e.g., building-site noise)18.
However, investigating in how far natural vs. urban auditory stimuli might infuence this symptom category has,
to our knowledge, not systematically been studied yet. Te present study thus addressed the following hypotheses:
(1) birdsong (vs. trafc noise) soundscapes have a benefcial efect on mood and paranoia; (2) birdsong (vs. trafc
noise) soundscapes have a benefcial efect on cognitive performance. Furthermore, it was investigated whether
greater (vs. lower) diversity of bird species or noise sources within the soundscapes would be a relevant factor,
modulating the efects. Te outcomes (mood, paranoia, cognitive performance) were each measured before and
afer soundscape exposure. For each soundscape type a low vs. high diversity version was created. Tis resulted
in a between 2 (type: birdsongs vs. trafc noise)×2 (diversity: low vs. high)×within 2 (timepoint: pre vs. post)
randomized experimental design.
Results
Perception of soundscapes. Te results of the MANOVA, revealed signifcant efects of type (F(3,
276)=78.6, p<0.001, ηp

2=0.461), diversity (F(3, 276)=3.16, p=0.025, ηp

2=0.033), as well as type × diversity (F(3,
276)=2.66, p=0.028), suggesting that all of these factors as well as their interaction had a signifcant impact on
the perception of soundscapes (i.e., ratings on monotony/diversity, beauty, and pleasantness).
Univariate follow-up ANOVAs revealed for the factor type, that it only signifcantly afected beauty (F(1,
278)=168.8, p < 0.001, ηp

2=0.378) and pleasantness perceptions (F(1, 278)=182.3, p < 0.001, ηp

2=0.396), but

not monotony/diversity type (F(1, 278)=0.06, p=0.812, ηp

2=0.000). Concerning the factor diversity, it only sig-
nifcantly afected the monotony/diversity ratings type (F(1, 278)=6.21, p=0.013, ηp

2=0.022), but not the other

rating dimensions of beauty (F(1, 278)=0.84, p=0.361, ηp

2=0.003) or pleasantness (F(1, 278)=0.58, p=0.448,

ηp
2=0.002). Finally, concerning the interaction type×diversity, there were no signifcant efects on monotony/
diversity (F(1, 278)=0.75, p=0.387, ηp

2=0.003) nor beauty (F(1, 278)=2.84, p=0.093, ηp

2=0.010), but on pleas-
antness (F(1, 278)=5.36, p=0.021, ηp

2=0.019).

For statistical details on the post-hoc tests, see Table 1, (for descriptive data on the qualitative sound ratings
see Supplementary Table 1). Low vs. high diversity conditions difered signifcantly from one another on the
according monotony/diversity rating dimension, albeit with a small efect size. Tis efect was attributable to a
signifcant small rating diference between the low and high trafc noise conditions; however, the low vs. high
bird conditions were not perceived as signifcantly diferent concerning monotony/diversity. Tis speaks for
only a partially successful manipulation of diversity. Both beauty and pleasantness were always perceived as
signifcantly higher for the birdsong conditions in any given comparison with the trafc noise conditions (all
p<0.001), with large efect sizes.
Mood and paranoia. Univariate analyses of variance revealed no baseline diferences across the groups in the
outcome variables at baseline for depression (F(3, 291)=0.31, p=0.820), or anxiety (F(3, 291)=0.31, p=0.821).

However, across the groups there were signifcant diferences in state paranoia (F(3, 291)=3.34, p=0.020). For
details (exact group diferences and descriptive baseline data), see Supplementary Table 2.
For depression, there was a signifcant time efect (F(1, 291) = 4.51, p = 0.035, η2

partial = 0.015), suggesting
overall changes in depressive states from pre-to-post. Te soundscape type× time interaction was signifcant
(F(1, 291)=32.1, p<0.001, η2

partial=0.099), the triple interaction type×diversity×time was non-signifcant (F(1,

291)=1.52, p=0.217, η2

partial=0.005), suggesting that diversity was not a modulating factor of the diferential pre-
post-change by type. Additional analyses were run to check the robustness of the efects i.e., controlling for state

paranoia age, and positive symptoms which difered signifcantly (paranoia) or at trend (p<0.10; age, positive
symptoms) at baseline as covariates, and excluding cases who did not type in at least one digit of the auditory
codeword at the end of the soundscape correctly (=listening compliance check). Te results of these analyses
were comparable to the above reported ones. Post-hoc examination of the efects by computing within group
dependent t-tests revealed that depressive symptoms signifcantly increased within both the low diversity urban
soundscape (T(1, 82)=2.64, p=0.010, d=0.29) and high diversity urban condition (T(1, 68)=4.88, p < 0.001,
d=0.59), whereas there were diferential efects in the birdsong conditions with no change in the low diversity
condition (T(1, 62)= −1.49, p=0.142, d= −0.19) but a signifcant decrease in the high diversity condition (T(1,
60)= −2.57, p=0.012, d= −0.29) (see Fig. 1).
For anxiety, there was a signifcant time efect (F(1, 291)=39.9, p<0.001, η2

partial=0.121), suggesting overall
changes in state anxiety from pre-to-post. Te soundscape type×time interaction was signifcant (F(1, 291)=30.1,
p < 0.001, η2
partial = 0.094), the triple interaction type × diversity × time was non-signifcant (F(1, 291) = 0.15,
p=0.704, η2
partial=0.000), suggesting that diversity was not a modulating factor of the diferential pre-post-change
by type. Additional analyses were run to check the robustness of the efects (for details see previous section),
which revealed that the fndings were not altered by entering the covariates and/or excluding cases with incorrect
codeword (failed listening compliance check). Post-hoc within-group t-tests for anxiety revealed that there were
no efects within both trafc noise conditions (low diversity: T(1, 82)= −1.37, p=0.174, d= −0.15; high diversity:
T(1, 68) = 0.49, p = 0.629, d = 0.06), whereas there were signifcant declines in both birdsong conditions (low
diversity: T(1, 62)= −6.13, p<0.001, d= −0.77; high diversity: T(1, 60)= −6.32, p<0.001, d= −0.70) (see Fig. 1).

As paranoia levels difered signifcantly at baseline between the groups, instead of a 2×2×2 repeated meas-
ures ANOVA approach, univariate ANCOVA, with paranoia at baseline as covariate and post-test paranoia as

outcome, predicted by type and diversity as factors, was computed. Type was a signifcant factor explaining post-
test paranoia (F(1, 290)=45.5, p<0.001, η2

partial=0.070), diversity was non-signifcant (F(1, 290)=0.50, p=0.480,

partial=0.002), as was the interaction type × diversity (F(1, 290)=0.18, p=0.670, η2

partial=0.001). Finally, for para-
noia there were no changes in the trafc noise conditions (low diversity: T(1, 82)= −0.55, p=0.583, d= −0.06;

high diversity: T(1, 68)= 0.67, p =0.507, d=0.08), but signifcant decreases in both birdsong conditions (low
diversity: T(1, 62)= −5.90, p<0.001, d= −0.74; high diversity: T(1, 60)= −4.11, p<0.001, d= −0. 46) (Fig. 1).
Cognition. Univariate analyses of variance revealed no baseline diferences across the groups in the cognition
outcome variable at baseline for the forward digit span two-error maximum length (TE_ML) measure (F(3,
291)=0.45, p=0.720), or the according backward digit span measure (F(3, 291)=0.15, p=0.962). Univariate
analyses of variance also revealed no baseline diferences across the groups in the cognition outcome variable at
baseline for the dual n-back measure d prime (F(3, 291)=1.01, p=0.388).
Concerning the two-error maximum length digit span forward, there was no signifcant time efect (F(1,
281) = 1.1, p = 0.298, η2

partial = 0.004). Te time × soundscape type interaction efect was also not signifcant

(F(1, 281)=0.2 p=0.662, η2

partial=0.001), as well as the time×type×diversity triple interaction (F(1, 281)=1.1,

p=0.296, η2
partial=0.004). Te same null-fnding emerged for the according backward digit span measure: time
(F(1, 281)=0.30, p=0.582, η2

partial=0.001), time × soundscape type (F(1, 281)=1.04, p=0.308, η2

partial=0.004) and

time×type×diversity (F(1, 281)=1.2, p=0.278, η2

partial=0.004). For the n-back task total performance param-
eter, there were also consistent null-fndings. Tere was no signifcant efect of time (F(1, 287)=0.37, p=0.543,

η2
partial=0.001) or time×soundscape type (F(1, 287)=0.23, p=0.635, η2

partial=0.001) nor time × type × diversity

(F(1, 287)=1.12, p=0.279, η2

partial=0.004). Additional analyses were run to check the robustness of the efects
i.e., controlling for state paranoia age, and positive symptoms which difered signifcantly (paranoia) or at trend
(p<0.10; age, positive symptoms) at baseline as covariates, and excluding cases who did not type in at least one
digit of the auditory codeword at the end of the soundscape correctly (=listening compliance check). Te results
of these analyses were comparable to the above reported ones. At last, an aggregation of both task scores into a
composite z-score, which is an established practice in the feld16, did not yield a signifcant result either.
Discussion
Te present study built up a previous study by van Hedger et al.16, who demonstrated that a natural vs. urban
soundscape was related to better cognitive outcomes, but failed to demonstrate signifcant efects on mood. In the
present study, birdsongs were contrasted with trafc noise, whereby a novel diversity factor (low vs. high number
of birdsongs or trafc noise sources in the soundscapes that participants were exposed to) was introduced, and
efects on paranoia were additionally tested (for the rationale see “Introduction” section).
Opposed to van Hedger et al.16 in the present study only efects on mood (depression, anxiety) and paranoia,
but not on cognition (dual n-back, digit span task), were found. Trafc noise soundscapes generally aggravated

depressive states (small efect in low diversity, moderate efect in high diversity condition), whereby these sound-
scapes were also perceived as signifcantly diferent in terms of diversity in subjective ratings, which were con-
ducted as a manipulation check at the end of the study. Exclusively the highly diverse birdsong soundscape

decreased depressive states (small efect size). Generally, the birdsong conditions were not rated as signifcantly
diferent in terms of diversity. Concerning anxiety, trafc noise soundscapes had no efect, whereas both birdsong
soundscapes signifcantly alleviated anxiety (medium efect sizes). Finally, the trafc noise soundscapes had
no efect on paranoia, whereas again both birdsong soundscapes signifcantly lowered it (medium efect sizes).

Te benefcial efects of birdsongs in particular concerning mood and attention restoration have been previ-
ously observed20. Mood recovery (e.g., afer a stressor) or benefcial mood efects have repeatedly been reported

for exposure with natural sounds21,22. Te present study thus confrms prior fndings. Moreover, to the best of
our knowledge, benefcial efects of natural soundscapes on state paranoia are shown for the very frst time. Tis

fnding might be explained in several ways. Birdsongs might be implicitly associated with a vital natural environ-
ment, divert attention away from (internal and external) stressors, or could signal the absence of acute threat.

Urban soundscapes on the other hand might trigger socio-evaluative concerns, involuntarily direct attention
resulting in perceived loss of control and hence alter vigilance to potential threats which are processes proposed
to elicit paranoia. However, somewhat contradicting the latter notion, the trafc noise soundscapes as used in
the present study did not increase paranoia. Possibly, by adding human voices to the audio fle, this efect could
have been evoked. Human voices may more readily activate interpersonal sensitivity, to which a central role
has been ascribed in the emergence and maintenance of paranoia23. Generally, classical learning paradigms
(conditioning) might provide a framework to explain restorative nature efects. Hereby, frst an unconditioned
positive response occurs in reaction to nature, which gets later retrieved by similar natural cues, and can later
generalize to an abstract level whereby even more abstract cues (e.g., words) may trigger the original response24.
Neither urban (trafc noise) nor natural (birdsong) soundscapes had any efect on cognitive performance,
which, at frst glance, seems to contradict a previous study, which implemented the same cognitive tests (i.e., digit
span and dual n-back)16. An explanation for the null efect could be the degree to which the administration of
the tasks was controlled. Te current study was performed online, practice was restricted to two blocks (i.e., in a
laboratory setting, participants can ofen train for as long as they wish/need), and hence there was little control
over the degree to which subjects understood the task correctly (albeit visual inspection of the raw data did not

reveal severe deviations from an expected performance). In addition, the online as opposed to a laboratory situ-
ation does not allow for controlling context variables or systematically manipulating baseline levels of stress or

fatigue21. Besides the highlighted methodological issues with respect to the cognitive outcomes of the current
study, it could be debated whether such an efect of exposure to nature on cognitive performance as measured by
executive functioning tasks really exists on a population level. Support for the existence of this efect originally
comes from a study in which mere viewing of pictures from nature improved cognitive performance11. Tis was
subsequently replicated with auditory exposure to nature in the form of soundscapes using the same cognitive

tasks that were also administered in the current study16. Summing up this debate there hence seems to be pre-
liminary support for the existence of such an efect on a population level, however future meta-analyses about

this efect should be carried out in order to clarify the existence of the efect.
Concerning the fact that there was no diference between the high and low diversity soundscapes of birdsongs
with respect to the efects on mood and paranoia it should be mentioned that in a study by Methorst et al.15
where bird species diversity in a given region was shown to be related to reported life-satisfaction in that region,
the authors suggest two explanations which are also relevant in the light of the afore-mentioned result. It is
concluded that the multisensory experience of birds can be a crucial factor for diversity of birdsongs to have an
efect on life-satisfaction. Yet another explanation is that benefcial landscape properties in fact drive the efects,
promoting both bird diversity and people’s life-satisfaction independently of one another. In the current study
it might be the case that merely listening to a more diverse birdsong soundscape did not communicate the same

multisensory experience than it does when people are experiencing bird diversity in a real-life situation. Fur-
thermore, the appreciation of diversity might rely on certain knowledge or expertise, resulting in a beneft only

for experienced listeners. Potentially, our sample did include mostly lay people concerning bird listening, which
could partially explain the result with respect to the diversity variable (i.e., the soundscapes were not rated as
signifcantly diferent from one another in terms of monotony/diversity). Future studies investigating this topic
should aim to include some kind of expertise measurement in order to control for this factor.
Limitations

One limitation of the present study is the numerically higher percentage of males relative to females (albeit non-
signifcant), which is a typical problem encountered in online studies. Future studies should stratify the subgroups

by sex, such as to balance the sample in this regard. Furthermore, the manipulation of low vs. high diversity of
the soundscapes was only partially successful. Namely, although the soundscape composition followed a logical
rationale in this regard, and the subjective diversity rating the urban soundscapes signifcantly difered in the
trafc noise soundscapes, this was not the case for the birdsong conditions. To assure stronger contrasts, and
hence to be able to test the diversity hypothesis more aptly concerning enhanced benefcial efects, the contrast
between the soundscapes needs to be further enhanced in future studies. In addition, mixed conditions such as
urban soundscapes containing birdsongs would be a highly interesting research target, as this could more readily
refect daily life exposure situations.
It remains to say that the current study made use of a non-clinical sample opening the debate if the observed
efects can also be generalized to people diagnosed with high levels of e.g., paranoia. Taking into account the
continuum hypothesis, which states, that psychotic symptoms which are seen in patients can also be observed in
non-clinical populations, it might be the case that both populations share a mechanism by which symptoms can

be relieved or improved. Tis remains speculative, nevertheless the current study can be seen as a pilot, exploring
the existence and potential magnitude of efects, feasibility, and safety for a future transfer to a more vulnerable
clinical sample. Future research could adopt the current design and investigate the efects of birdsong exposure

on paranoia within a clinical sample. Such research can potentially result in low threshold environmental inter-
ventions to reduce distress in e.g., psychiatric wards or other clinical settings. In the sense of conditioning (see

above), associations with natural environments might divert attention away from psychological stressors or
signal the absence of acute threat. Future experiments could aim to explore if paranoia does in fact not decrease
afer exposure to threatening natural environments, such as the wilderness, or situations which signal the acute
presence of threat, such as natural disasters.

Moreover, it is important to highlight the fact, that the results of the current study cannot provide any clarifca-
tion concerning the sustainability or replicability (e.g., by repeated exposure) of the efect birdsongs can have on

mood and paranoia. Future research should aim to test such efects in a longitudinal and/or repeated exposure
study design. Yet another limitation in the current study is the lack of a neutral control sound condition which
would enable the interpretation of results with respect to a neutral condition instead of the mere comparison
between a trafc condition and a birdsong condition. Te use of such a neutral control group within a similar
design as implemented by the current study would be a great addition for future research. Finally, although the
instructions required participants to set their audio system loudness to 80%, still subjectively perceived loudness
of the soundscapes could constitute a confounding factor.

Conclusion. Te present study provides evidence for the benefcial efects of birdsongs on mood (depres-
sion, anxiety) and paranoid symptoms, with the latter being shown for the frst time. On the other hand, the

negative efects of trafc noise were only confrmed concerning depressive symptoms. Te manipulated low
vs. high diversity of the soundscapes did not have a signifcant efect, which might in part be explained by no
perceived subjective diferences concerning monotony vs. diversity. Further replication in vulnerable, elevated
risk- or clinical groups could be of interest to assess the magnitude of efects given pre-existing symptoms and
cognitive performance defcits. In case of replication, using birdsongs as ‘soothing’ background soundscape
could open interesting new possibilities in psychiatric hospitals or other therapeutic settings.
Methods
Power calculation and study registration. A power calculation was conducted for an interaction efect
(repeated measures ANOVA), in G*Power 3.1.9.7 with f=0.10, α=0.05, power=0.90, 4 groups, correlation
between repeated measures r=0.60, resulting in a minimum required total sample size of N=288 (n=72 per
group). According to the general rule of thumb for Cohen’s f statistic, f≥0.10<0.25 is a small efect, f≥0.25<0.40
is a medium efect, and, f≥0.40 a large efect (see Cohen, 1988)25. We opted for a small efect size as a similar
study as ours, conducted by van Hedger et al.16, also using a repeated-measures ANOVA data analysis approach,
reported interaction efects type ([2] natural vs. urban soundscapes) by time ([2] pre-to-post exposure) on mood,
whereby Cohen’s d for negative afect was between 0.36 and 0.40. Tese results were non-signifcant, as the
study was underpowered for detecting small efects. Te interaction efects observed concerning cognition in
that paper, applying the same tests as in the present paper, were large (d between 0.71 to 0.76). Since we were
interested in detecting efects on mood and to study yet unknown efects on state paranoia, we opted for and
intermediate efect size between small and medium.
Te study was pre-registered at aspredicted.org (study name: “Sounds_Online”, trial identifer: #67702, https://
aspredicted.org/d5j7j.pdf) on 06/04/2021.
Recruitment and in‐ and exclusion criteria. Te study was programmed using Inquisit 526 (https://
www.millisecond.com) and accordingly run on the Millisecond server. Participants were recruited from the
crowdsourcing platform Prolifc and received 10€ reimbursement for their full participation. Adult individuals
were pre-screened on Prolifc (i.e., visibility of the study only for candidates with a suited profle) concerning
fuent German language skills (as this was the study language), having no diagnosed lifetime mental illness, and
having no hearing difculties. Pre-screened individuals could then access the study, where in- and exclusion

criteria were checked further. Tis included no regular substance or drug intake, no suicidal thoughts, or tenden-
cies, and availability of headphones for the purpose of the study.

Study procedure. Afer providing informed consent, sociodemographic information was assessed, includ-
ing education, income, and further variables, which were assessed for potential additional or exploratory analy-
ses, but for the sake of conciseness are not reported in this paper. Psychosis liability was assessed. For an accord-
ing overview on sample characteristics, see Table 2. Hereafer, pre-test assessments were conducted, including

an assessment of mood (depression, anxiety), paranoia, the digit-span, and n-back tasks. Participants were ran-
domized to one of four sound conditions: (1) low diversity trafc noise soundscape n=83, (2) high diversity

trafc noise soundscape n=69, (3) low diversity birdsong soundscape n=63, or (4) high diversity birdsong
soundscape n=80, (for details on the stimuli, see “Stimuli” section). Te soundscapes each lasted for exactly
6 min. Participants were instructed to set their audio system volume to 80% (which was piloted with members
of our research unit beforehand and deemed to be an optimal average volume) and to listen to the sounds until
the end, when participants were required to continue by clicking with their mouse. Participants were told that a
code, consisting of two spoken digits (in German), would be audible towards the end of the sound presentation,
which they were required to type in correctly aferwards. Tis was implemented to assure listening-compliance
and attention. Afer the sound presentation, the pre-test measures were repeated. Finally, several items to assess
perceived sound quality, including beauty, pleasantness, and monotony (vs. diversity) were presented.

Sample. Initially, N=401 individuals started the survey. Of those, n=76 quit during the sociodemographic
assessment, n=24 lacked pre-test data, and n=6 lacked post-test data. Tese n=106 cases were excluded from
the analyses, resulting in a fnal sample of N=295. Of these, some participants had incomplete post-test data
(n=10 missing digit span, 5 missing n-back, and n=8 missing the qualitative assessments [sound rating]).

For detailed information and inferential statistics comparing the groups at baseline see Table 2. Te partici-
pants were in their middle to late twenties on average and there were in tendency more males than females. Net

income was mostly reported to be in the lowest category (i.e.,< 1.250€, 40–50% of participants of all groups),
but also between 5 and 20% of participants did not wish to reveal their monthly net income. Positive symptom
frequency levels did not difer signifcantly between the groups, albeit there were relatively marked descriptive
diferences (p=0.058). Te values were mostly similar and within a confdence interval range that has previously
been reported for healthy individuals19. Due to the trend-level nature of the diferences in positive symptom
frequency, we decided to repeat the main analyses, controlling for this variable as covariate in the repeated
measures ANOVAs.
Measures. For all mood and the paranoia scales, item scores were computed (i.e., summing up responses
on all items and dividing this by the number of items). Tis way, the interpretation of scores is facilitated, as it
corresponds to the Likert-scale of the respective measure.
Psychosis liability. Psychosis-liability or sub-clinical psychosis levels was assessed using the Community
Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE)19, in its German version, to assesses lifetime positive, negative and

depressive symptoms (http://www.cape42.homestead.com/index.html). Te CAPE, including the German ver-
sion, has been validated extensively17. Items refer to the lifetime prevalence of specifc symptoms, rated on an

ordinal response scale for frequency (categories: 1=‘never’, 2=‘sometimes’, 3=‘ofen’, 4=‘nearly always’). Te
total scale consists of 42 items, whereby the positive symptom scale includes 20 (e.g., ‘Do you ever feel as if things
in magazines or on TV were written especially for you?’), the negative symptom scale 14 (e.g., ‘Do you ever feel
that your mind is empty?’), and the depressive symptom scale 8 items (e.g., ‘Do you ever feel like a failure?’). To
test for comparative baseline levels across all groups in psychosis liability, mean frequency scores for the positive
symptom subscale was used, for which Mossaheb and colleagues have provided descriptive data for individuals
with ultra-high risk for psychosis (n=84) vs without risk (i.e., healthy controls; n=81)19. Te positive dimension
(frequency) of the CAPE had excellent internal consistency in the present sample, with Cronbach’s α=90.
Mood and paranoid symptoms. Mood was assessed with the State Trait Anxiety Depression Inventory
(STADI)27. Te scale contains 40 items, whereby the same 20 items are once presented in trait and once in state

German school system has three type of school degrees; lowest=‘Hauptschulabschluss’, which can be acquired
afer the 9th, middle=‘Realschulabschluss’, which can be acquired afer the 10th, and high=‘Abitur’, which
can be acquired afer the 12th or 13th school year. 2Scores can range from 1 to 4, which indicate the average
lifetime frequency of psychotic (positive or negative symptoms) symptoms (1=never, 2=sometimes, 3=ofen,
4=nearly always). For reference: Mossaheb et al.19 report means (SD) for frequency on the positive symptom

format. Only the latter was used in the present study. Te scale diferentiates between depression (low euthymia
[inverted items], dysthymia) and anxiety (hyperarousal and worry), whereby each of the subscales is assessed by

5 items. Te response format is a 4-point Likert (1=‘not at all’, 4=‘strongly applies’). Internal consistency (Cron-
bach’s α) at pre-test was good both for the state anxiety (0.85) and depression (0.86) scales.

Paranoia was assessed with a brief, change sensitive state version of the paranoia checklist, which has been
validated and comparable to the long, state adapted 18-item version17. Te scale comprises 3 statements (e.g.,
‘I need to be on my guard against others’, ‘Strangers and friends look at me critically’, ‘People try to upset me’),
rated on an 11-point Likert-scale (each from 1 to 11) for the degree of agreement to the statement, associated
distress and conviction, at present. Te latter two categories were only presented if the rating of agreement to the
statement was>1 (which accordingly ofen results in a large amount of missing data). In the present study, only
agreement was evaluated. Internal consistency at pre-test was acceptable with Cronbach’s α=0.78.
Cognition. To assess digit span cognitive performance, both the forward and backward version were used,
as available in Inquisit 526 [retrieved from https://www.millisecond.com] which is based on the original task
reported by Woods et al.28. Two parameters are recommended for evaluation: the two-error maximum length
(TE_ML) and the maximum length recalled (ML). Te two-error maximum length is defned as the last digit
span a participant gets correct before making two consecutive errors while the maximum length is the digit span
that a participant recalled correctly during all trials irrespective of the number of errors in-between. Starting
with a successive visual presentation of 3 digits, the participants need to correctly recall a by 1 digit increasing
sequence of digits and reproduce it by clicking on the correct digits in correct order. Afer two wrongly recalled
sequences of the same length, the digit span is decreased by 1 digit until the digit span length again reaches the
starting point of 3. Te total amount of trials is 14 making the shortest span possible 3 digits long and the longest
span 16 digits long. Te participants were explicitly reminded not to use any memory assisting methods such
as paper and pencil. Te dual n-back task, also available in the Inquisit 526 (retrieved from https://www.milli
second.com) was assessed. Te task is based on the original work by Jaeggi et al.29. It consists of 4 experimental
blocks demanding 2-back and 3-back level performance. While performing the task, subjects pay attention to
their computer screen while also listening to a computer audio. On each trial a blue square appears in one out
of eight grid-like locations around a central fxation cross, while at the same time a (German) letter is presented
via the headphones. In the 2-back block condition, the subjects are instructed to press the “A” button on their
keyboard when the current square position matches the square position from two trials before. Subjects are
also instructed to press the “L” button on their keyboard if the spoken letter matched the letter two trials before.
Te same instruction, but having to match stimuli 3 trials back, is provided for the 3-back condition. In the
present study, participants trained each condition once, and then went on with the experimental blocks. Te

performance parameter was the so-called d prime value calculated as the proportion of ((visual_TotalHits−vis-
ual_TotalFA)+(auditory_TotalHits−auditory_TotalFA)/2)/number of total experimental blocks. Te highest

possible d prime (greatest sensitivity) was 6.93 and the lowest was 0. Visual hits are defned as correct responses
with respect to the location of the square and auditory hits are defned as the correct responses with respect to
the spoken letter. Visual false alarms (FA) are defned as responses in the absence of a target in the visual domain,
thus with respect to the location of the square and auditory false alarms are responses in the absence of a target
in the auditory domain, thus with respect to the spoken letter.

Soundscape perception. Te participant’s perception of the soundscapes was assessed using a one item ques-
tionnaire per dimension (diversity/monotony, pleasantness, and beauty). Participants were asked to report on

a 0 to 100 visual scale how diverse/monotone, beautiful, and pleasant they had perceived the soundscape they
had listened to during the experiment. Te items have been formulated by the authors themselves while the
use of an aesthetic rating of the soundscapes per se was a replication from the van Hedger et al.16 study where
we exchanged the “like–dislike” afective response with a more detailed aesthetic rating splitting the response
up into a pleasantness and a beauty dimension. Te dimension of diversity/monotony has been to perform a
manipulation check on diversity for the soundscapes used in the present study.

Stimuli. Te soundscapes for all four categories have been generated in the same way. Single sound snip-
pets were gathered and then adapted and merged within the audio sofware Steinberg Cubase10. An exemplary

visualization of the resulting soundscape can be seen in the Supplementary Material (see Supplementary Fig. 1).
For the nature category a database of birdsong recordings (https://www.xeno-canto.org/explore/region) from
a central European origin was used. For the low diversity birdsong condition, eight recordings from the same
two species were used (common chifchaf & wood warbler). For the high diversity birdsong condition, the
same approach was chosen, but recordings from eight diferent bird species were used to create the soundscape
(garden warbler, honey buzzard, woodlark, Eurasian sparrow hawk, coal tit, greenshank, common crane, and
black woodpecker). In both birdsong conditions, additionally subtle water and wind sounds were played in the
background, to create a constant auditory experience. For the trafc noise conditions, sound snippets from
eight car recoding’s (https://freesound.org/search/?q=city) were used for the low diversity trafc noise condition
while audio-snippets from eight diverse sources of noise pollution associated with the city were used for the
high diversity trafc noise condition (ambulance siren, construction, trucks, train, motorcycle, airplane, bus and
fre-fghter siren). In both trafc noise soundscapes, a constant subtle trafc fow was audible in the background.
To ensure that all soundscapes were perceived with a similar loudness level, all soundscapes were engineered
to have a similar loudness value. Te loudness values from all four conditions range between 19.4 and 27.8
loudness units relative to full scale (LUFS). All soundscapes had a duration of 6 min. Prior to the experiment
the soundscapes have been presented to a small set of pilot participants rating the similarity of the audio level

ensuring a comfortable audio level across all conditions. As a result, at the beginning of the experiment, par-
ticipants were instructed to set their headphone loudness level to 80%. Soundscapes can be accessed openly via

this link https://osf.io/4y3vh/.

Statistical analyses. Analyses were run in SPSS 27 (IBM Corp., 2020). To test the diferences of all meas-
ures at baseline, several univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were run. In order to test the efects of high vs.

low diverse trafc noise vs. birdsong soundscapes on mood, paranoia, and cognition, repeated measures analyses
of variance (ANOVA) were run testing for a 2 (timepoint: pre vs. post)×2 (soundscape type: birdsong vs. trafc
noise)×2 (diversity: low vs. high) interaction efect. Te analyses were once run with all participants, and then

only with those who entered at least one of the digits (control of compliance of listening to audio, see “Study pro-
cedure” section) correctly, to check for the robustness of fndings. In order to further check for the robustness of

efects on mood and cognition repeated measures ANOVAs were run controlling for baseline sample diferences
on sample characteristics or outcomes (i.e., state paranoia, age and positive symptoms) as covariates. To check
the robustness of efects on paranoia a univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with paranoia at baseline as
covariate and post-test paranoia as outcome, predicted by type and diversity as factors, was computed. Signifcant
interactions (i.e., of interest were the type×time and type×diversity×time) interactions identifed for any of the
outcomes were followed up by subsequent detailed post-hoc-tests. To explore mean diferences between the
qualitative ratings of soundscapes (i.e., beauty, pleasantness, and monotony vs. diversity), a one-way multivariate

analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted. In case of signifcant omnibus tests indicating global difer-
ences across the qualitative sound rating dimensions, follow-up between group t-tests were conducted. Due to

the exploratory nature of the study, no p-level correction was applied.
Te partial eta squared efect size was used to interpret the ANOVA based analyses, with the corresponding
rule of thumb defning η2=0.01 as a small efect size, η2=0.06 as a medium efect size and η2=0.14 as a large
efect size30. Cohen’s d efect size was used to interpret post-hoc test efect sizes, with the corresponding rule of
thumb defning a value of≥0.2 as a small efect size, a value of≥0.5 as a medium efect size and a value of≥0.8
as a large efect size. Te criteria for interpreting the efect size for Hedge’s g stem from the corresponding rule
of thumb with the same defnition30.
Ethics statement. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance
with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki
Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all
participating subjects. Te experimental protocol was approved by the ethical committee from the University
Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf.
