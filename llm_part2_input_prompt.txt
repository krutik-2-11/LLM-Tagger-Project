You will be given a json .
The key of the json is the name or title of the research paper. The value is a list that has the research paper keywords.

You will do the following:
Create a json document where you will generate the similar papers. The similarity will be the key. Each key will have a value that is a list.
Inside the list is the name of the paper that shares that topic.
The topics generated in the output document may not necessarily be the same as the topics in the input document.
You may exercise judgment on whether the topics are similar enough where you can categorize papers under a different topic that you have created, given that it makes sense and is not too far off.  
In the output document you may discard topics where there is only 1 paper that matches a topic.

Make sure that the cluster labels are not too similar too each other. Also make sure you do not name the clusters as 
"Cluster 1", "Cluster 2" etc... Don't make clusters with just 1 paper add the paper to the most relevant cluster.
