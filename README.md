Large Language Model-based Topic Extractor for Academic Literature
This repository contains the code and resources related to our paper titled "Navigating the dynamic landscape of academic literature using a Large Language Model-based topic extractor." 
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for clustering academic literature using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method aims to address the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of 
knowledge and the vast volume of research available, which can make it difficult to identify relevant information within specific domains.

# Abstract
Navigating the dynamic landscape of academic literature presents challenges due to the rapid evolution of knowledge and the sheer volume of available research, 
which can obscure information within specific domains. The current use of descriptive tags for literature clustering, although helpful, lacks standardization and often fails to cover broad or multi-topic literature adequately. 
To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based topic extractor for academic literature. 
We measure the quality of the clusters using established indices, the silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Dunn Index. 
Our proposed approach performs better than traditional methods, demonstrating that it not only aids in the clustering of unlabeled and unstructured textual data but also highlights the potential for improvement in document clustering 
practices through the use of large language models. Consequently, our findings pave the way for researchers, academics, and other professionals to organize academic papers more effectively, employing a simple, yet advanced, methodology. 

# Currently we defined the test cases as below:
- Test Case 1: Input papers belong to multiple different categories
- Test Case 2: Input papers all belong to the same category
- Test Case 3: Input papers belong to two different categories
